<h2>The short</h2>
<div class="callout">
<ul>
<li><strong>Layered systems</strong> fragment oversight.</li>
<li><strong>Diffuse responsibility</strong> weakens ownership.</li>
<li><strong>Process</strong> replaces judgment.</li>
<li><strong>Information</strong> becomes filtered through hierarchy.</li>
<li><strong>Failure</strong> hides within structure.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The growth of layers</h2>
<p>
As organizations expand, they accumulate structure. New divisions require managers. Managers require reporting lines. Reporting lines require review mechanisms. Governance expands in response to complexity.
</p>
<p>
Each layer serves a purpose. Each adds coordination.
</p>
<p>
Yet each also increases distance between action and responsibility.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>From ownership to procedure</h2>
<p>
In small systems, accountability is direct. Decisions have identifiable authors. Outcomes are visible. Feedback is personal.
</p>
<p>
At scale, responsibility shifts from individuals to processes. Committees evaluate. Subcommittees approve. Risk is reviewed by multiple parties.
</p>
<p>
When outcomes deteriorate, causality becomes ambiguous.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The comfort of diffusion</h2>
<p>
Diffuse responsibility reduces individual exposure. When decisions pass through multiple hands, no single actor appears fully accountable.
</p>
<p>
Procedural compliance substitutes for substantive ownership. The question becomes whether protocol was followed — not whether judgment was sound.
</p>
<p>
Complexity can therefore protect institutions from blame while increasing systemic fragility.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Information distortion</h2>
<p>
Layered structures filter information upward. Reports summarize. Dashboards compress nuance. Edge cases are smoothed into averages.
</p>
<p>
Leaders receive representations of reality shaped by hierarchy.
</p>
<p>
Distortion is rarely malicious. It is structural.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The governance paradox</h2>
<p>
More oversight does not always produce more clarity. In highly complex systems, additional controls may multiply reporting without sharpening accountability.
</p>
<p>
The paradox is that safeguards designed to reduce risk can dilute ownership.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The takeaway</h2>
<p>
Complexity is often necessary.
</p>
<p>
But it carries hidden cost.
</p>
<p>
When responsibility diffuses into structure, failure becomes harder to trace — and therefore harder to prevent.
</p>
<p>
Accountability must be engineered deliberately.
