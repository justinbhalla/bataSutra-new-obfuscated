<h2>The short</h2>
<div class="callout">
<ul>
<li><strong>Acceleration</strong> shortens evaluation windows.</li>
<li><strong>Competition</strong> discourages hesitation.</li>
<li><strong>Information</strong> becomes filtered under time pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Oversight</strong> weakens incrementally.</li>
<li><strong>Risk</strong> accumulates before recognition.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The premium on velocity</h2>
<p>
Modern capital markets reward speed. Private equity firms compete on rapid deal execution. Venture funding cycles compress during bull markets. Public offerings are prepared under intense time constraints to capture favorable windows.
</p>
<p>
Speed reduces uncertainty in one dimension: timing. But it increases uncertainty in another: evaluation.
</p>
<p>
The faster the transaction, the narrower the space for reflection.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Compressed scrutiny</h2>
<p>
Due diligence is not merely a procedural step. It is a cognitive process — one that benefits from iteration, contradiction, and dissent.
</p>
<p>
When timelines tighten, certain forms of analysis are deprioritized. Edge cases receive less attention. Scenario modeling shortens. Legal and regulatory review focuses on material risks, sometimes overlooking systemic ones.
</p>
<p>
Under competitive pressure, hesitation carries cost. Caution appears as inefficiency.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Incentives under acceleration</h2>
<p>
In rising markets, the penalty for delay often outweighs the penalty for error. Missed opportunities are visible. Future losses remain hypothetical.
</p>
<p>
This asymmetry reshapes behavior. Decision-makers begin to internalize speed as competence. Boards reward decisive action. Investors reward momentum.
</p>
<p>
Over time, acceleration becomes cultural.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Systemic implications</h2>
<p>
Isolated shortcuts may be manageable. But when compression becomes widespread, oversight across the system thins simultaneously.
</p>
<p>
Financial history offers repeated reminders. From pre-2008 mortgage underwriting to pandemic-era speculative financing, periods of rapid capital deployment often precede structural correction.
</p>
<p>
Speed does not cause failure. It reduces the margin for catching it.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The strategic balance</h2>
<p>
Organizations cannot afford paralysis. Markets move. Opportunities close. Deliberation has cost.
</p>
<p>
The question is not whether to move quickly, but where to preserve friction. Independent review, scenario stress testing, and dissent mechanisms provide institutional counterweight to momentum.
</p>
<p>
Friction, in this sense, is not delay. It is insurance.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The takeaway</h2>
<p>
Speed increases throughput.
</p>
<p>
It also compresses scrutiny.
</p>
<p>
In competitive markets, acceleration feels rational.
</p>
<p>
Durability depends on preserving space for doubt.
