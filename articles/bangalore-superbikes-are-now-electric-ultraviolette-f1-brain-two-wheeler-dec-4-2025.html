    <h1>Bangalore Superbikes Are Now Electric: Inside Ultraviolette’s F1-Brain Two-Wheeler</h1>
    <div class="sub">
      Bengaluru used to bond over spec sheets for gaming laptops. Now it’s doing the same for electric motorcycles: high top speed, long range, traction control, dashcams and apps. With fresh funding from Zoho and Ferrari-linked capital, Ultraviolette is trying to build India’s first true “software engineer superbike.”

  <h2>The short</h2>
  <div class="callout">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ultraviolette</strong>, based in Bengaluru, has raised a fresh round of capital from Zoho and Italy-based Lingotto (linked to Ferrari’s owner Exor) to scale its electric motorcycles.</li>
      <li>The <strong>F77</strong> and new <strong>X47 crossover</strong> live in superbike territory: high peak power, strong top speeds, substantial battery packs and serious torque.</li>
      <li>The pitch is emotional as much as green: track-inspired design, rider-assistance tech, dashcams, connected dashboards and Touring editions that look like weekend fantasy builds.</li>
      <li>For Bengaluru’s tech crowd, this isn’t just an EV — it’s a <strong>side-project with wheels</strong>: spec talk, mods, weekend rides, and Discord-level community energy.</li>
      <li>The open question: can India’s charging, roads and wallets support a premium, software-first motorcycle habit at scale?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>What exactly did Ultraviolette build?</h2>
  <p>
    Start with the numbers. The F77 platform and the new X47 aim for what the company calls “electric performance motorcycles,” not commuter scooters:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Peak power:</strong> in the region of a serious 300–400cc petrol bike.</li>
    <li><strong>Top speed:</strong> positioned firmly in high double digits on the speedometer, depending on variant.</li>
    <li><strong>Battery:</strong> a large pack by two-wheeler standards, with higher-spec variants crossing into double-digit kWh territory.</li>
    <li><strong>Range:</strong> claimed to support both daily use and weekend rides on a single charge for many users, depending on mode and riding style.</li>
    <li><strong>Torque:</strong> instant and plentiful, delivered from standstill without needing to hunt gears.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The X47 adds a more upright stance, extra suspension travel and rider aids — an EV crossover motorcycle that can play city bike on weekdays and “let’s go find bad roads” on weekends.
  </p>
  <p>
    Put simply: this is the kind of spec sheet that used to live in gaming PCs, not bikes.
  </p>
</section>

  <h2>From garage project to Ferrari-adjacent money</h2>
  <p>
    The fresh funding round is emotionally important, not just financially:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Zoho</strong> — a rare, profitable Indian SaaS company — is backing an Indian hardware bet.</li>
    <li><strong>Lingotto</strong> is connected to a European investment house linked with Ferrari’s parent holding.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    For riders, this doesn’t affect the traffic light. For the category, it’s a signal: performance EV bikes in India are no longer a side project — they’re part of a serious global capital stack.
  </p>
  <p>
    The stated use of funds: scale F77 and X47 production, expand to new cities and markets, and keep pushing the software and electronics side of the platform.
  </p>

  <h2>A superbike that behaves like a gadget</h2>
  <p>
    Ultraviolette’s bikes borrow more from smartphones and race telemetry than from classic commuter bikes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Multiple ride modes</strong> with distinct power and regeneration settings rather than just Eco/Normal/Sport labels.</li>
    <li><strong>Connected dash</strong> with on-board connectivity, ride analytics, alerts, over-the-air updates and remote diagnostics.</li>
    <li><strong>Advanced rider aids</strong> on higher-end models: collision alerts, blind-spot warnings and lane awareness concepts.</li>
    <li><strong>Dual dashcams</strong> on select variants — because if your ride isn’t recorded, did it even happen?</li>
    <li><strong>Accessories as identity</strong> — touring kits, storage options, and styling add-ons; your bike is an avatar as much as a machine.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The overall vibe is clear: this is a machine for people who love to tweak settings, watch charts and talk in numbers — which happens to be a pretty good description of Bengaluru’s day job population.
  </p>

  <h2>Is this practical… or a very fast toy?</h2>
  <p>
    The honest answer is: both.
  </p>
  <h3>Where it makes surprising sense</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Daily commute:</strong> instant torque and strong regeneration make stop–go traffic less punishing.</li>
    <li><strong>Running costs:</strong> electricity vs petrol, lower maintenance (no oil, fewer moving parts) — once you get past the sticker shock, per-km costs can look friendly.</li>
    <li><strong>Range:</strong> a genuine mixed-use range that, for many owners, covers a week of commuting plus a weekend breakfast ride without anxiety.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Where reality bites</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Upfront price</strong> in the premium bracket makes this an emotional purchase, not a “family decision.”</li>
    <li><strong>Charging convenience</strong> still depends heavily on home/office access — overnight charging in a shared parking lot is not yet a solved problem everywhere.</li>
    <li><strong>High-speed infrastructure</strong> (roads, enforcement, rider training) hasn’t grown at the same pace as spec sheets.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    For now, think of it as: a manageable superbike for people who don’t want an oil leak in their basement and do want torque on tap.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>What this says about Indian EV culture</h2>
  <p>
    Scooters made EVs visible. Performance bikes make them aspirational.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cities like Bengaluru</strong> now have a credible EV subculture: group rides, charging etiquette, “range flexing” and nerdy arguments about test cycles vs real-world numbers.</li>
    <li><strong>Local hardware</strong> starts to feel cool again — not just imported cars and phones, but Indian-built kit with global money and ambition behind it.</li>
    <li><strong>Two-wheeler OEMs</strong> can no longer treat “electric” as a compliance corner; there is now a visible benchmark for performance and design.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    It’s still niche. But it’s the kind of niche that tends to define what the mainstream will want five years from now.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Rule — for choosing your first performance EV bike</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Spec sheet vs life sheet.</strong><br/>
    Before fixating on top speed, write down three numbers from your actual life:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Your <strong>daily distance</strong> (home↔office↔errands) on a normal weekday.</li>
    <li>Your <strong>longest realistic weekend ride</strong> in kilometres, not fantasies.</li>
    <li>The <strong>farthest socket</strong> you can trust (home, office, friend’s place).</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    If the bike covers (1) for a week, (2) in one charge or one planned stop, and fits (3) without drama, you’re not buying a toy. You’re upgrading your life.
