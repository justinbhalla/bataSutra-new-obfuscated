    <div class="sub">
      Our solar system is getting a rare guest: interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, a small dirty iceball on a one-way path from another star’s neighbourhood. 
      It has already zipped past the Sun and will glide by Earth at a safe distance on December 19, 2025 — then vanish into deep space for good.

  <h2>The short</h2>
  <div class="callout">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>3I/ATLAS</strong> is only the <strong>third confirmed interstellar object</strong> after ʻOumuamua and Borisov — its orbit is so stretched that it is not bound to the Sun at all.</li>
      <li>It passed closest to the Sun in late October and now travels outward; on <strong>December 19</strong> it reaches closest approach to Earth at roughly <strong>170 million miles</strong> away, nearly twice our distance from the Sun.</li>
      <li>From India, it is a <strong>telescope target</strong>, not a naked-eye show: around magnitude 11–12, sliding through Virgo and into Leo as December rolls on.</li>
      <li>Hubble, ESA’s Juice spacecraft and ground observatories have already captured detailed images and spectra; scientists will squeeze in more observations before the object fades and leaves the neighbourhood.</li>
      <li>You can still treat it as an event: a reason to step out to a dark-sky site, join a local astronomy group, or simply know that one tiny streak in a professional image came from a world that never belonged to our own.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>What “interstellar” really means here</h2>
  <p>
    Most comets we hear about—Halley, Hale–Bopp, last year’s bright visitor—are long-period residents of the Sun’s extended family. 
    Their paths are stretched ovals that keep them loosely tied to our star.
  </p>
  <p>
    3I/ATLAS is different. 
    Its orbit is <strong>hyperbolic</strong>, with an eccentricity well above 1. 
    In practical terms, that means:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>it dropped into the inner solar system from far beyond our usual comet reservoirs,</li>
    <li>it will <strong>never loop back</strong> for a second visit, and</li>
    <li>its speed and trajectory mark it as debris from another planetary system entirely.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    ʻOumuamua, spotted in 2017, was the first such traveller we caught. 
    Borisov followed in 2019. 
    3I/ATLAS extends that sample: a third clue about how messy planet-building can be around other stars.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Where 3I/ATLAS is and when it passes closest</h2>
  <p>
    The comet swept through <strong>perihelion</strong>—its closest point to the Sun—towards the end of October, at a distance between Earth and Mars. 
    Since then, it has been moving outward on the far side of the Sun from us.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the night of <strong>December 19</strong>, it reaches its closest approach to Earth at roughly 1.8 astronomical units, about 270 million kilometres away. 
    That is:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>far too distant to pose any risk,</li>
    <li>close enough for serious instruments to study in detail, and</li>
    <li>just bright enough that patient amateurs with decent telescopes can still catch it as a faint fuzz.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Conveniently, the date coincides with a <strong>dark Moon</strong>, so observatories do not have to fight sky-glow from our own natural satellite.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>How—and whether—you can see it from India</h2>
  <p>
    A honest answer first: 3I/ATLAS will not turn the sky into a festival. 
    There will be no dramatic tail visible from balconies in big cities.
  </p>
  <p>
    What you can do instead:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Scope requirements:</strong> under dark, rural skies, you need something in the 8–10 inch class with good optics; under city light, it becomes an advanced target even for clubs.</li>
    <li><strong>Direction:</strong> through December it creeps across Virgo toward Leo; star charts or apps will carry updated coordinates as it moves.</li>
    <li><strong>Timing:</strong> early to mid-December, it rises before dawn; near closest approach, it becomes easier to place late at night as it shifts away from the Sun’s glare.</li>
    <li><strong>Realistic plan:</strong> find a local astronomy group, pay for a dark-sky session and let their tracking mount do the work while you look through the eyepiece.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If that sounds like too much trouble, treat 3I/ATLAS as a background story: something you follow via observatory livestreams and image releases rather than with your own lens.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Why observatories rushed to aim at this speck</h2>
  <p>
    For researchers, an interstellar comet is a free sample from someone else’s construction site. 
    Every photon it reflects or emits carries hints about:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>its composition</strong> — which ices evaporate, which dust grains scatter light, which gases appear in spectra,</li>
    <li><strong>its history</strong> — how activity switches on as it warms, how jets behave, whether the nucleus tumbles or spins smoothly, and</li>
    <li><strong>its birthplace</strong> — whether its chemistry looks more like our own Oort Cloud or like something we haven’t seen before.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    That is why Hubble, ESA’s Juice spacecraft near Jupiter, Mars orbiters and large ground telescopes have all taken turns. 
    Once 3I/ATLAS fades below reach, there is no “rewind” button.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>A balcony plan even without equipment</h2>
  <p>
    You can still turn this distant visitor into an excuse for a nicer night.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Pick one clear evening around the closest-approach week and step out somewhere safe with a mostly unobstructed view.</li>
    <li>Switch off or dim indoor lights behind you; let your eyes settle into the dark for at least ten minutes.</li>
    <li>Open a live sky map on your phone only when needed; keep brightness low so you do not undo the dark adaptation.</li>
    <li>Look up the region where 3I/ATLAS sits even if you cannot see the comet itself — trace the familiar stars around Virgo and Leo, notice how much of the sky you usually ignore.</li>
    <li>Later, compare your view with the latest Hubble or observatory image and realise you were looking in the same direction, just with a smaller mirror.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    The point is not to “spot” the comet at all costs. 
    It is to remember that a rock that formed under a different Sun is currently slicing through our patch of space.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Rule — one line to keep in mind on December 19</h2>
  <p>
    A simple mental note for the night of closest approach:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    “Somewhere above that horizon, an object from another star’s nursery is passing through our sky once, and never again.”
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    You may never see it directly. 
    But you will have watched the same sky while it was there, which is quietly enough.
