      <h2>The short</h2>
      <div class="callout">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Reality:</strong> Social-media trends now last ~5–10 days before fading out.</li>
          <li><strong>Challenge:</strong> Typical fast-fashion supply chains still need 25–45 days to design, produce, ship, and deliver.</li>
          <li><strong>Result:</strong> You shop a vibe, but it lands after the vibe dies — leading to rising cancellations and discount heavy-lifts.</li>
          <li><strong>Shift:</strong> Micro-drops, on-demand cut-make, and localised quick-turn production are becoming new standards.</li>
          <li><strong>Rule:</strong> If delivery + unboxing time ≥ 50% of trend lifespan, the trend loses value — treat it like a coupon, not couture.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>How micro-trends outpaced fashion cycles</h2>
      <p>
        Not long ago, fashion cycles moved by season — spring, summer, fall, winter — or at best by monthly “drops.” Trends rose, matured, and faded over weeks or months.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Enter short-video feeds, digital closets and influencer drops: today’s viral looks catch fire in hours, saturate feeds in a day, and blur into yesterday’s vibe by day 7 or 8.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Gen Z and younger shoppers, clothes aren’t wardrobe staples anymore — they’re content props, story punctuation, memes you wear. Fashion is now measured in digital half-lives.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Supply chain vs trend clock — the mismatch</h2>
      <p>
        Here’s what a typical “fast-fashion” timeline looks like today:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Design & tech-pack: 2–3 days</li>
        <li>Fabric sourcing & procurement: 4–7 days</li>
        <li>Cutting & stitching (batch): 5–10 days</li>
        <li>Quality checks, packaging, export/import: 5–12 days</li>
        <li>Logistics to consumer + last-mile delivery: 4–8 days</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Total: ~25–45 days from concept to doorstep. Compare that to a trend that starts on a Thursday and fades by the following Monday — you’re already stale before you arrive.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>What this mismatch creates — and why brands are scrambling</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rising cancellations:</strong> Early analyses from three major fast-fashion platforms show order cancels rose 18% between 2024 and 2025 — users treat shopping like pre-orders.</li>
        <li><strong>Deep discount cycles:</strong> Trend “afterglow” sells end up discounted 25–40% to clear inventory.</li>
        <li><strong>Brand fatigue:</strong> Influencers skip brand calls after one wear — once trend moves on, visibility drops instantly.</li>
        <li><strong>Returns surge:</strong> Due to hype-buying — clothes mismatched to real-life use — return rates climb 22% vs regular catalog buys.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Enter micro-drops & on-demand production</h2>
      <p>
        Some agile teams are rewriting the rules. Instead of mass batches, they:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Produce small lots — 50 to 200 pieces — only after orders come in.</li>
        <li>Use local or regional cutting houses to shave import/export delays.</li>
        <li>Offer digital previews (3D renders, AR try-ons) to pre-sell before manufacturing.</li>
        <li>Promise “24–72h dispatch” once stock is ready — trading margin for speed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This on-demand model aligns supply with social signal speed — and buyers respond.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The emotional cost: hype, regret, and the “dopamine drop”</h2>
    <p>
      Buying a trending outfit gives a rush — anticipation, dopamine, instant social signal.  
      But when the package arrives after the trend fades, the high evaporates fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many shoppers admit they feel “late,” “out of sync,” or “behind the meme.” The clothing isn’t junk — it’s simply a context-less object. The regret isn’t about quality — it’s about timing.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “That dress wasn’t even worn. By the time it came, the video was old news. It felt like I bought yesterday’s joke.”  
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Over time, this leads to two powerful reactions: apathy toward fast fashion, or loneliness — the feeling of chasing culture with a lag.
    </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why some companies still push the old supply chain</h2>
    <p>
      Because older cycles worked when marketing was slow, and returns were margin-driven.  
      Bulk orders, predictable shipments, economies of scale — those still matter for basics: underwear, socks, basic tees.
    </p>
    <p>
      The problem arises when brands try to treat trend-driven hype like demand for basics — the infrastructure collapses under speed pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until the economics for rapid turnaround make sense, there will always be a gap. But the gap is now too visible — and too costly.
    </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What to watch: early signs of a supply-side pivot</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Pop-up micro-factories near demand hubs (Delhi NCR, Los Angeles, Istanbul)</li>
        <li>Resale & rental-ready clothing tags indicating “Designed for 3-month life”</li>
        <li>“Pre-order → ship in 3 days” models getting premium checkout slots</li>
        <li>Brands collaborating with courier startups for sub-48h urban delivery</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The rule — bet the clock, not the fit</h2>
    <p><strong>If the time between click & closet exceeds half the social half-life — treat it as a coupon, not as fashion.</strong></p>
    <p>
      In the new economy of speed, timing matters more than trend, size, or style.  
      Forget the hanger. Watch the calendar.
