  <h2>The Short</h2>
  <div class="callout">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Appetite reset:</strong> Users on GLP-1 drugs report 20–40% calorie reduction without conscious dieting.</li>
      <li><strong>Consumption shock:</strong> Snacks, sugary drinks, QSR meals, alcohol — all trending lower in user cohorts.</li>
      <li><strong>Industry pivot:</strong> Food giants push protein/light lines; gyms pivot to strength-preserving programs.</li>
      <li><strong>Pharma front:</strong> Supply constraints drive record preorders; next-gen oral variants on the way.</li>

  <h2>A Drug That Quietly Rewrote the Dinner Table</h2>

  <p>You can’t see a macroeconomic shockwave as it begins — but you can see where people stop ordering fries. GLP-1 drugs (Ozempic, Wegovy, Zepbound, Rybelsus, and a growing list of cousins) are doing something no diet, no celebrity plan, and no wellness startup has ever fully achieved: they’re removing <em>desire itself</em>.</p>

  <p>The early users describe the same eerie moment: food stops shouting. Hunger shrinks from a roar to a whisper. Cravings lose their superpower. It feels voluntary — even though it isn’t.</p>

  <blockquote>
    “I don’t avoid junk food. I just… forget it exists.”
  </blockquote>

  <p>That one behavioral shift — forgetting — is reshaping multi-billion-dollar categories. Not because users suddenly become disciplined, but because their chemistry stopped pulling at them.</p>

  <p>And every business built on impulse? They can feel it.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Consumption Fallout — Category by Category</h2>
  <p>Across markets, early GLP-1 adoption is clustering in affluent urban segments — the exact consumers who drive high-margin categories. And the drop-off patterns are strikingly consistent.</p>

  <table class="table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Category</th>
        <th>Observed Change Among GLP-1 Users</th>
        <th>Business Impact</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Snacking</td>
        <td>20–30% less purchase frequency</td>
        <td>Pressure on chips, candy, and soda giants</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Fast Food / QSR</td>
        <td>Lower meal sizes; fewer impulse add-ons</td>
        <td>Check sizes drop; upcharge strategies emerging</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Alcohol</td>
        <td>Steep decline in both volume and frequency</td>
        <td>Bars, breweries report shrinking spend from key demographics</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Grocery</td>
        <td>Shift to protein, frozen produce, hydration</td>
        <td>Baskets tilt toward “functional” calories</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Beauty</td>
        <td>Rising demand for “skin tightening” solutions</td>
        <td>Brands pivot to firming serums and post-weight-loss care</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>The message across retail is clear: the old basket is dying. The new basket is smaller, more intentional, and shockingly stable.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Fitness Whiplash</h2>

  <p>A strange storyline is unfolding inside gyms. Subscription check-ins are up — but calorie-burn classes are half-empty. Instead, GLP-1 users are turning to low-impact strength training, Pilates, and mobility programs.</p>

  <p>The goal is no longer “lose weight.” It’s “don’t lose muscle.”</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cardio hours down:</strong> Why do HIIT when the drug does the deficit?</li>
    <li><strong>Strength hours up:</strong> Users don’t want the “skinny-weak” look.</li>
    <li><strong>Protein intake rises:</strong> Ironically, supplement brands benefit more than snack brands lose.</li>
    <li><strong>Gyms reposition:</strong> More resistance classes, fewer fat-burn banners.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For years, the fitness industry sold aspiration. Now it’s selling preservation.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Behind the Numbers</h2>

  <p>Beneath the macro charts sits something deeply human: relief. GLP-1 users talk about food noise disappearing. Late-night binges quieting. A sense of control replacing a sense of battle.</p>

  <p>Shame, guilt, and self-blame — the emotional tax that fueled entire diet industries — suddenly feel outdated. The drug doesn’t create discipline. It creates silence.</p>

  <p>For some, that silence is liberating. For others, it’s unsettling — like losing a familiar friend who was bad for you, but always there.</p>

  <blockquote>
    “I didn’t know how loud hunger was until it went quiet.”
  </blockquote>

  <p>Every economic signal begins with a personal shift. And this one is seismic.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Retail’s Fear: The Slow Death of Impulse</h2>

  <p>Impulse buying powers entire sectors — especially food retail, QSR, beauty add-ons, and convenience stores. If appetite softens, impulse collapses.</p>

  <h3>Three early tells:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Checkout candy racks shrinking</strong> in some markets.</li>
    <li><strong>QSR “meal deals” pivot</strong> to protein-heavy bundles.</li>
    <li><strong>C-stores boosting non-food SKUs</strong> (draught coffee, OTC, lottery).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Retail lives on the unplanned purchase. GLP-1 kills the “unplanned” part.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Pharma’s Jackpot — and the Limits</h2>

  <p>The pharma side of the GLP-1 story is explosive: demand is outpacing supply in multiple regions. New factories, new chemistries, and oral variants aim to meet the wave.</p>

  <p>But the long-term question is not capacity — it’s access. These drugs remain expensive. Insurance coverage varies wildly. And the biggest user base in the future may not be those seeking weight loss but those seeking metabolic stability.</p>

  <p>Pharma knows this. Which is why the next generation of molecules will target broader metabolic pathways:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Dual agonists (GLP-1 + GIP)</li>
    <li>Triple agonists (GLP-1 + glucagon + GIP)</li>
    <li>Oral small-molecule GLP-1 analogues</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Each new variant expands the funnel — and the business model — further.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Macro Impact — Consumption at 80%?</h2>

  <p>Imagine 10–15% of urban consumer populations reduce their caloric intake by 20–40%. Across a population, that’s a consumption shock of unprecedented scale.</p>

  <p>What happens to industries built on abundance? Promotions? Oversized portions? “Value meals” that depend on calorie arbitrage?</p>

  <p>Early signals say this:</p>

  <blockquote>
    “The most profitable calories are the ones people stop wanting first.”
  </blockquote>

  <p>Economists rarely model desire. GLP-1 forces them to.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Culture Shift: A New Aesthetic</h2>
  <p>There’s a cultural shock brewing — subtle, visual, and everywhere on social feeds.</p>

  <h3>New GLP-1 era aesthetics:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Smaller plates</li>
    <li>Protein bowls and hydration shots</li>
    <li>Strength-lean bodies instead of “thinspo”</li>
    <li>Low-effort exercise routines</li>
    <li>“Clean minimal eating” visuals</li>
  </ul>

  <p>People aren’t eating to fullness; they’re eating to neutrality. And social media is rewriting its aesthetic language around that neutrality.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Rule — To Understand the New Consumption Economy</h2>
  <p><strong>Watch the grocery basket.</strong> When protein stays steady and snacks fall for three straight months in a region, you’re seeing GLP-1 penetration — whether or not anyone reports it.</p>

  <p>The GLP-1 era is not the future. It’s already in the receipts.</p>
