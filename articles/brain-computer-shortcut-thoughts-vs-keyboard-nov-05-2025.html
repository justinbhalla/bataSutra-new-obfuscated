      <h2>The short</h2>
      <div class="callout">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Latency:</strong> Pilots report end-to-end latency near ~0.3 seconds in controlled runs — fast enough for near-real-time text entry in demos</li>
          <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Lab figures look promising for short vocab and deliberate intent; free-form typing still trails keyboard/voice in error rate. </li>
          <li><strong>Practical limits:</strong> Calibration time, headwear comfort, and noise from everyday activity remain the gating factors for daily use.</li>
          <li><strong>Tradeoffs:</strong> non-invasive gear wins safety and ease; invasive implants win raw signal quality — but implant adoption is tiny for consumers.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why now</h2>
      <p>Two things changed this year. First, algorithmic progress: algorithms that map neural patterns to intended text are getting better at decoding short, repeated signals (think: “yes/no”, intended letter groups). Second, hardware: low-profile EEG and new dry electrodes let firms ship lighter headsets for trials. Together they turn thought-to-text from lab trick to pilot product in niche apps (assistive devices, fast game inputs, VR UI).</p>
      <p>Companies running public pilots emphasise short training runs and repeated prompts rather than true freeform typing. That shifts the current value case from replacing keyboards to adding a new input layer for specific tasks.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How it actually works (short primer)</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Sensing:</strong> non-invasive electrodes on scalp read tiny voltage shifts tied to neural activity.</li>
        <li><strong>Pre-processing:</strong> filters and artifact removal strip blink and muscle noise.</li>
        <li><strong>Decoding:</strong> trained networks map patterns to intents — trigger a word, a short phrase, or a character group.</li>
        <li><strong>Output & feedback:</strong> quick on-screen correction trains the model in minutes.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Pilot numbers that matter</h2>
      <table class="table">
        <thead><tr><th>Stat</th><th>What it means</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td>Latency ≈ 0.3 s (demo runs)</td><td>Feels near real time for short inputs; acceptable for UI toggles and short chat phrases.</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Accuracy (short vocab) ≈ 85–94%</td><td>Good for command sets; poor for unrestricted prose — error correction still needed.</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Calibration time</td><td>Typical pilot: 5–20 minutes per user to reach stable decoding (varies by model & headset).</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Comfort</td><td>Light headbands pass 30–60 min comfort tests; heavier rigs fail for casual daily use.</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Real world use cases today</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Assistive typing for users with limited motor control is the clearest early win — BCIs can match or beat existing switch setups in narrow tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Gaming & VR:</strong> quick action triggers and short chat phrases in virtual worlds — less typing, more presence.</li>
        <li><strong>AR wearables:</strong> silent commands when voice is impossible (noisy places, privacy needs).</li>
        <li><strong>Productivity pilots:</strong> corporate UX tests where typed macros, not free text, speed workflows.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Limits that will decide adoption</h2>
      <p><strong>Calibration drift:</strong> models can need re-calibration across days and environments. The more time a product asks for at the start, the lower its stickiness.</p>
      <p><strong>Privacy & consent:</strong> continuous neural data is intimate. Firms are testing explicit consent flows, on-device short retention windows, and granular opt-outs — but legal frameworks lag the tech. </p>
      <p><strong>False positives:</strong> accidental activations (conversation nearby, head moves) are worse than slower but reliable inputs.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Vendor landscape & where to watch</h2>
      <p>Two camps: non-invasive consumer headsets and clinical/implant players. The consumer race focuses on comfort and repeated small-task decoding; the clinical space pushes raw throughput for assistive use. Watch for public pilot results, SDK releases, and developer builds that show third-party apps shipping real features.</p>
      <p class="callout"><strong>Key signals:</strong> SDK adoption, number of third-party apps with BCI support, and metrics on calibration time in day-to-day settings.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Ethics, leak risk, and sensible guardrails</h2>
      <p>Privacy is not abstract here: raw neural signals can reveal attention, stress, and other private states. Early ethical frameworks emphasise on-device processing, ephemeral feature vectors (not raw traces), and explicit consent for each app. Those practices will decide consumer trust more than a slightly better latency number.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What to watch (next 6 months)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Public pilot papers with multi-user, in-the-wild numbers (latency & accuracy across noise conditions). :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}</li>
        <li>SDKs that let small apps ship BCI features (think: keyboard autocomplete by thought).</li>
        <li>Comfort benchmarks — how many users tolerate a session >60 minutes without re-adjustment.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>One rule</h2>
      <p><strong>Rule:</strong> Treat BCI as a new input layer, not a keyboard replacement — size trials by session time, not headline speed. Start with 10–15 min pilots in low-risk apps.</p>
