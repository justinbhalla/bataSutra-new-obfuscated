      Agreement feels reassuring.
      But consensus forms after uncertainty shrinks —
      not while discovery is still alive.

<h2>The short</h2>
<div class="callout">
<ul>
<li><strong>Belief:</strong> Consensus equals truth.</li>
<li><strong>Reality:</strong> Consensus follows resolution.</li>
<li><strong>Risk:</strong> Early agreement freezes inquiry.</li>
<li><strong>Signal:</strong> Real science is noisy and unsettled.</li>
<li><strong>Lesson:</strong> Disagreement is productive.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why consensus feels comforting</h2>
<p>
Consensus simplifies complexity.
</p>
<p>
It provides closure, authority, and shared language.
In uncertain environments, agreement feels like progress.
</p>
<p>
But comfort is not discovery.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>How consensus actually forms</h2>
<p>
Scientific agreement emerges after:
</p>
<ul>
<li>multiple replications,</li>
<li>failed alternatives,</li>
<li>and narrowed uncertainty.</li>
</ul>
<p>
By the time consensus arrives, the most interesting questions are often already resolved.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The danger of premature agreement</h2>
<p>
When consensus forms too early, it shapes incentives.
</p>
<p>
Researchers stop asking disruptive questions.
Funding flows toward confirmation.
Dissent becomes costly.
</p>
<p>
The field stabilises — before it understands itself.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why disagreement signals health</h2>
<p>
Active disagreement means multiple hypotheses remain alive.
</p>
<p>
It reflects uncertainty being explored, not suppressed.
</p>
<p>
Fields without disagreement are often finished —
or stuck.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Consensus as an endpoint, not a guide</h2>
<p>
Consensus is useful for application, policy, and education.
</p>
<p>
It is less useful for discovery.
</p>
<p>
Treating agreement as a compass leads science backward —
toward what is already settled.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The takeaway</h2>
<p>
Truth emerges before agreement.
</p>
<p>
When science looks messy, contested, and unresolved,
it is often doing its best work.
