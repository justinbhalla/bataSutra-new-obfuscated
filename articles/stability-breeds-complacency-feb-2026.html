<h2>The short</h2>
<div class="callout">
<ul>
<li><strong>Stability</strong> lowers perceived risk.</li>
<li><strong>Extended calm</strong> compresses vigilance.</li>
<li><strong>Incentives</strong> adapt to recent experience.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage</strong> rises when volatility falls.</li>
<li><strong>Fragility</strong> accumulates quietly.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The comfort of predictability</h2>
<p>
Periods of prolonged stability reshape behavior. Markets grow accustomed to modest volatility. Institutions assume continuity. Policymakers begin to interpret calm as structural improvement rather than cyclical reprieve.
</p>
<p>
When disruptions are absent for long enough, they become difficult to imagine. Risk models incorporate recent data. Risk appetite expands.
</p>
<p>
The memory of instability fades faster than the conditions that created it.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Incentives shift under calm</h2>
<p>
Low volatility compresses perceived risk premiums. Borrowing appears cheaper. Leverage appears manageable. Asset valuations rise. The absence of recent crisis reduces the urgency of precaution.
</p>
<p>
In such environments, defensive structures look excessive. Capital buffers seem inefficient. Redundancy appears unnecessary.
</p>
<p>
Stability, paradoxically, encourages exposure.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The bubble burst</h2>
<p>
Economic history reflects a recurring dynamic: stability encourages risk-taking, which eventually destabilizes the system. During extended expansions, caution erodes incrementally. Small adjustments compound.
</p>
<p>
The process is rarely dramatic. It is gradual. Debt ratios edge upward. Margins tighten. Stress testing becomes routine rather than urgent.
</p>
<p>
By the time volatility returns, structural fragility has already accumulated.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Institutional blind spots</h2>
<p>
Governance systems often struggle to respond to risks that are not immediately visible. Boards reward growth. Shareholders reward return. Regulators adjust to prevailing calm.
</p>
<p>
Extended tranquility changes culture. Prudence feels pessimistic. Restraint feels inefficient.
</p>
<p>
Exposure becomes normalized.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The strategic implication</h2>
<p>
Resilient institutions maintain vigilance precisely when it appears unnecessary. They preserve margin when markets encourage expansion. They stress-test during prosperity rather than distress.
</p>
<p>
Calm periods are not signals of reduced risk. They are signals of deferred recognition.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The takeaway</h2>
<p>
Stability improves performance in the short term.
</p>
<p>
But extended calm can distort perception.
</p>
<p>
Vigilance that fades quietly must be rebuilt deliberately.
</p>
<p>
Fragility rarely announces itself in advance.
