    <h1>Why Stable Revenue Can Hide Strategic Decay</h1>
    <div class="sub">
      Predictable numbers feel reassuring.
      But stability can quietly mask eroding relevance,
      shrinking options, and delayed reckoning.

<h2>The short</h2>
<div class="callout">
<ul>
<li><strong>Comfort:</strong> Flat revenue signals control.</li>
<li><strong>Blind spot:</strong> Competitive position erodes silently.</li>
<li><strong>Risk:</strong> Optionality disappears before numbers move.</li>
<li><strong>Pattern:</strong> Stability delays uncomfortable questions.</li>
<li><strong>Lesson:</strong> Revenue health is not strategic health.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why stability feels like success</h2>
<p>
Boards and executives are trained to fear volatility.
Stable revenue offers relief: forecasting is easier, narratives are cleaner,
and external scrutiny softens.
</p>
<p>
In uncertain environments, consistency is framed as competence.
But consistency can also mean stasis.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>What decays beneath stable numbers</h2>
<p>
Strategic decay rarely shows up in topline figures first.
It appears elsewhere:
</p>
<ul>
<li>pricing power weakens,</li>
<li>customer dependence concentrates,</li>
<li>talent gravitates toward maintenance, not creation.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Revenue stays flat because inertia is powerful —
not because advantage is intact.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The illusion of control</h2>
<p>
Stable revenue creates the impression that risks are understood.
But many risks are only postponed.
</p>
<p>
When margins compress or demand shifts,
organisations realise too late that flexibility was already spent.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why alarms fail to trigger</h2>
<p>
Most dashboards are built to detect movement, not erosion.
</p>
<p>
As long as numbers hold, warning signals —
declining experimentation, slower decision cycles,
narrower ambition — remain invisible.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The strategic cost of waiting</h2>
<p>
By the time revenue breaks, options are fewer and costlier.
</p>
<p>
What could have been adjustment becomes restructuring.
What could have been renewal becomes defence.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The balance that works</h2>
<p>
Healthy organisations treat stability as a question, not an answer.
</p>
<ul>
<li>What assumptions keep revenue stable?</li>
<li>Which capabilities are quietly weakening?</li>
<li>Where is optionality shrinking?</li>
</ul>
<p>
Stability should buy time — not silence inquiry.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The takeaway</h2>
<p>
Stable revenue can mean strength.
It can also mean delayed decline.
</p>
<p>
Strategy decays long before numbers do —
and by the time numbers move, strategy has already run out of room.
