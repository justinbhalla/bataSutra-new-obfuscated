    <div class="sub">
      Processes make organisations scalable.
      Judgment makes them adaptable.
      When the former crowds out the latter, failure becomes procedural.

<h2>The short</h2>
<div class="callout">
<ul>
<li><strong>Benefit:</strong> Process reduces variance and error.</li>
<li><strong>Risk:</strong> Over-reliance dulls situational awareness.</li>
<li><strong>Failure mode:</strong> Rules replace thinking.</li>
<li><strong>Signal:</strong> “We followed procedure” becomes a defence.</li>
<li><strong>Lesson:</strong> Judgment cannot be automated.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why process scales so well</h2>
<p>
Processes exist for a reason.
They capture past learning and convert it into repeatable action.
</p>
<p>
They lower cognitive load, reduce ambiguity, and make outcomes predictable.
In stable environments, this is powerful.
</p>
<p>
The problem is not process.
It is forgetting what process is for.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>What judgment actually does</h2>
<p>
Judgment is not rule-breaking.
It is context recognition.
</p>
<p>
It asks:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Does this situation resemble the one the process assumed?</li>
<li>What has changed?</li>
<li>What matters most right now?</li>
</ul>
<p>
Judgment fills the gaps process cannot anticipate.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>How process crowds judgment out</h2>
<p>
As organisations mature, procedures accumulate.
</p>
<p>
Over time:
</p>
<ul>
<li>deviation becomes suspicious,</li>
<li>interpretation becomes risky,</li>
<li>and discretion becomes liability.</li>
</ul>
<p>
People learn that following rules is safer than thinking.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The illusion of control</h2>
<p>
Heavy process creates a comforting illusion:
that the system is under control because everything is documented.
</p>
<p>
But documentation is not awareness.
</p>
<p>
When reality diverges from assumptions, the organisation reacts slowly —
because no rule tells it what to notice.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why failures become procedural</h2>
<p>
After breakdowns, postmortems often reveal the same phrase:
</p>
<p><em>“All procedures were followed.”</em></p>
<p>
This is not reassurance.
It is diagnosis.
</p>
<p>
It means the system failed while behaving exactly as designed.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The balance that works</h2>
<p>
Healthy organisations treat process as scaffolding, not substitution.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Rules guide.</li>
<li>Judgment decides.</li>
<li>Feedback updates both.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Process should support thinking — not replace it.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The takeaway</h2>
<p>
Process scales the past.
Judgment protects the future.
</p>
<p>
When organisations stop trusting judgment, they stop adapting —
even while everything appears to be running smoothly.
