      For decades, efficiency was treated as an unquestioned good.
      But in tightly optimized organizations, small shocks now trigger outsized failures.

<h2>The short</h2>
<div class="callout">
<ul>
<li><strong>Shift:</strong> Businesses optimized relentlessly for cost and speed.</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Systems lost slack, buffers, and resilience.</li>
<li><strong>Trigger:</strong> Disruptions exposed hidden fragility.</li>
<li><strong>Reality:</strong> Efficiency amplifies failure when conditions change.</li>
<li><strong>Lesson:</strong> Redundancy is not waste — it is protection.</li>
</ul>

<section>
<h2>How efficiency became a religion</h2>
<p>
From manufacturing floors to software teams, efficiency became a moral virtue.
Lean staffing, just-in-time supply chains, and constant utilization were praised as discipline.
</p>
<p>
Anything unused was labeled waste.
Any pause was framed as laziness.
</p>
<p>
The system worked — as long as nothing went wrong.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>What fragility looks like in practice</h2>
<p>
Modern failures are rarely dramatic at the start.
They begin with small disruptions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>a delayed shipment,</li>
<li>a key employee leaving,</li>
<li>a minor software outage.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In tightly optimized systems, there is no margin to absorb impact.
Problems cascade instead of stabilizing.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why efficiency amplifies risk</h2>
<p>
Efficiency removes options.
</p>
<p>
When every resource is fully utilized, there is nothing left to reassign.
When every process is tuned for speed, there is no room for inspection.
</p>
<p>
What looks optimal on spreadsheets becomes brittle in reality.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The hidden value of slack</h2>
<p>
Slack — extra time, extra people, extra inventory — appears inefficient.
But it performs critical functions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>absorbing shocks,</li>
<li>enabling recovery,</li>
<li>allowing judgment under pressure.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Slack converts surprise into survivability.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why resilience is returning</h2>
<p>
After repeated disruptions, companies are re-learning old lessons.
</p>
<p>
They are holding more inventory.
Rebuilding internal teams.
Accepting slower but safer processes.
</p>
<p>
Not because it feels good — but because fragility is expensive.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The takeaway</h2>
<p>
Efficiency maximizes performance in stable conditions.
Resilience determines survival when conditions change.
</p>
<p>
The strongest organizations are no longer the leanest —
they are the ones built to bend without breaking.
