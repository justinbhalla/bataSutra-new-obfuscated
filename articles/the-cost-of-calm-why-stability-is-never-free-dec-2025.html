    <h1>The Cost of Calm: Why Stability Is Never Free</h1>
    <div class="sub">
      Screens look steady. Volatility is lower. Commentaries talk about resilience.
      Underneath that quiet surface, someone is paying for it — through liquidity, policy choices, trade-offs and future risk.
      Calm is not comfort. Calm is a bill that arrives later.

      <h2>The short</h2>
      <div class="callout">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Stability is built, not gifted:</strong> central banks, governments and firms all spend political and financial capital to keep things quiet.</li>
          <li><strong>Costs are often delayed:</strong> lower volatility today can mean higher debt, more distortions or sharper adjustments tomorrow.</li>
          <li><strong>Calm hides asymmetry:</strong> the benefits are widely enjoyed; the real bills are paid by specific sectors, future taxpayers or smaller players.</li>
          <li><strong>Key idea:</strong> treat calm like a scarce resource to invest — not a mood that just “happens”.</li>
          <li><strong>Playbook:</strong> use quiet phases to strengthen balance sheets, hedge properly and clean up dumb risks.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Calm looks emotional. It’s actually engineered.</h2>
      <p>
        When markets settle down after a rough patch, the human instinct is to exhale.
        “Things are fine again.” Indices are stable, bond yields stop screaming, currency charts flatten out.
      </p>
      <p>
        What you rarely see is the machinery behind that quiet:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>liquidity injections that smooth funding shocks,</li>
        <li>FX operations that guide panic out of the system,</li>
        <li>subtle regulatory nudges that cool speculation,</li>
        <li>and sometimes, unsustainable promises that push discomfort into the future.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Calm, in other words, is a **policy outcome**, not an act of fate.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Who pays for stability?</h2>
      <p>
        Every phase of visible stability has an invisible invoice. The question is never “Is there a cost?”
        The question is “Who pays, and when?”
      </p>

      <table class="table">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Tool used</th>
            <th>Calm created</th>
            <th>Hidden cost</th>
            <th>Who pays</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Liquidity injections</td>
            <td>Bond yields ease, funding crunch softens</td>
            <td>Higher future inflation risk or asset bubbles</td>
            <td>Households, savers, late buyers</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>FX intervention</td>
            <td>Currency volatility tamed</td>
            <td>Reserve depletion, opportunity cost of dollars</td>
            <td>Future policy space, taxpayers</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Regulatory forbearance</td>
            <td>Defaults and stress delayed</td>
            <td>Zombie firms, mispriced risk, moral hazard</td>
            <td>Healthy competitors, banks, public balance sheet</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Rate caps / subsidies</td>
            <td>Short-term affordability and relief</td>
            <td>Fiscal strain, underinvestment elsewhere</td>
            <td>Future budgets, public services</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>
        The trick is not to avoid these tools — they are necessary.
        The trick is to remember that **somebody always picks up the tab**.

      <h2>The politics of calm: comfort now, consequences later</h2>
      <p>
        Calm is politically addictive. Leaders love low volatility. Voters like predictability.
        Businesses prefer gentle charts to violent swings.
      </p>
      <p>
        That creates a bias:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Intervene early to reduce visible pain.</li>
        <li>Delay tough reforms that could create short-term discomfort.</li>
        <li>Push real adjustments into “later” — another year, another budget, another term.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Over time, this turns into a quiet problem: the system looks steady, but
        risk has been repositioned into corners that don’t show up on front pages.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why “no crisis” can be a warning sign</h2>
      <p>
        An economy with no small crises often ends up with a very large one.
        Small failures, small defaults and small price corrections act like safety valves.
      </p>
      <p>
        When policies keep smoothing every bump:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>weak firms stay alive longer than they should,</li>
        <li>asset prices drift away from fundamentals,</li>
        <li>households grow used to low volatility and low perceived risk.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Then, when external conditions finally turn, the adjustment is harsh because the system never practised smaller corrections.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>How businesses should read “calm”</h2>
      <p>
        For operators, the most dangerous interpretation is:
        “volatility is over, so we can relax.”
      </p>
      <p>
        A better reading is:
      </p>
      <div class="callout">
        Calm is a grace period offered by the system.
        Intelligent players use it to fix balance sheets, not extend risk.
      </div>

      <div class="grid">
        <div class="card half">
          <h3>Use calm to repair</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Pay down expensive short-term debt.</li>
            <li>Increase liquidity buffers and undrawn lines.</li>
            <li>Close obvious FX and rate gaps in your books.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="card half">
          <h3>Use calm to rethink</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Stress-test models at harsher macro assumptions.</li>
            <li>Re-price products that rely on unrealistic stability.</li>
            <li>Redesign contracts to share risk more fairly.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The emotional trap: confusing calm with safety</h2>
      <p>
        Humans are wired to treat quiet periods as “back to normal”.
        That’s fine for everyday life. It is dangerous for capital allocation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Markets often feel safest near the top of a cycle, not the bottom.
        Risk is highest when the system is collectively relaxed, leverage is high,
        and few people remember what pain felt like.
      </p>
      <p>
        The point isn’t to live in fear.
        The point is to separate **emotional comfort** from **systemic risk**.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Smart questions to ask during quiet regimes</h2>
      <p>
        If you run capital — as a founder, CFO, investor or policymaker — a calm tape should trigger questions, not only relief.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Which risks have actually gone down, and which have just moved?</li>
        <li>Are we depending on support measures that may be withdrawn suddenly?</li>
        <li>What happens if one major assumption flips — growth, rates, commodity prices, or politics?</li>
        <li>Where are we taking comfort because the chart looks flat, not because the fundamentals improved?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Honest answers to these questions are worth more than any rally.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>When calm is worth its price</h2>
      <p>
        Not all calm is bad. Some of it is deeply worth paying for.
        Financial stability buys time for reforms. Predictable inflation helps the poorest.
        A stable banking system protects both depositors and small businesses.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal is not chaos; the goal is clarity:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pay for calm when it protects the vulnerable and buys real reform.</li>
        <li>Avoid paying for calm just to hide problems until the next electoral or corporate quarter.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The takeaway: treat calm as capital</h2>
      <p>
        Calm phases are often sold as happy endings.
        They are actually starting points — brief windows where systems give you the luxury to prepare.
      </p>
      <p>
        Used well, today’s quiet becomes tomorrow’s resilience.
        Used badly, today’s comfort becomes tomorrow’s shock.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stability is never free. The only choice you have is whether you use it as **fuel** or as **anaesthesia**.
