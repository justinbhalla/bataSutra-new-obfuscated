    <h1>Your Body Clock Isn’t 24 Hours — It’s 24.2</h1>
    <div class="sub">
      Deep in your brain, a cluster of cells keeps time. Left alone, that clock doesn’t run on a 24-hour loop. 
      It drifts — slowly, predictably — and light, screens, and alarm clocks spend every day pulling it back.

      <h2>The short</h2>
      <div class="callout">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Baseline:</strong> In controlled studies without cues, the average human “free-running” day is slightly longer than 24 hours — often around 24.1–24.3 hours.</li>
          <li><strong>Consequence:</strong> Left unchecked, sleep and wake times drift later; social schedules yank them back.</li>
          <li><strong>Daily levers:</strong> Morning light, evening light, caffeine, exercise, and meals all nudge the clock.</li>
          <li><strong>Emotion:</strong> That jet-lagged, out-of-sync feeling on a Monday morning? It’s your inner 24.2-hour day arguing with your 24-hour world.</li>
          <li><strong>Rule:</strong> Treat light as a drug: tiny doses, right times, big effects on how you feel this week — and years from now.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Meet the clock in your head</h2>
      <p>
        Between your eyes and your ears, above the crossing of your optic nerves, sits a tiny control center: the 
        <strong>suprachiasmatic nucleus</strong> (SCN). About 20,000 neurons, smaller than a rice grain, ticking away electrical rhythms that ripple out to the rest of your body.
      </p>
      <p>
        The SCN tells your brain when to release melatonin, when to raise your core temperature, when to expect food, when to repair tissue. 
        It doesn’t care about your inbox. It cares about one signal above all: light.
      </p>
      <p>
        And here’s the twist: when scientists isolate humans from clocks, social cues, and changing daylight, our internal day is not exactly 24 hours. 
        It tends to run a little long — enough that, over days, you would drift later and later, going to sleep and waking in slow motion around the dial.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What “24.2 hours” really means</h2>
      <p>
        In classic chronobiology experiments, volunteers lived in bunkers or sealed apartments without windows, clocks, or phone signals. 
        They controlled their own lights and routines. Researchers watched when their bodies chose to sleep, wake, and secrete hormones.
      </p>
      <p>
        Across participants, one pattern kept appearing:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sleep onset shifted later by roughly 10–20 minutes per “day.”</li>
        <li>Core body temperature peaks slid later too.</li>
        <li>Melatonin release patterns followed, completing a slow, graceful drift.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When you convert that drift into a daily period, you land near ~24.2 hours for many healthy adults. Not everyone. Not exactly. But enough that “slightly longer than 24” is now a textbook line.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        The human body didn’t evolve in a city with blue LEDs. It evolved under a sun that arrived like clockwork. 
        Our internal clock expects to be gently reset by that sunrise every day.
      </blockquote>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Social jet lag: when your clock and your calendar disagree</h2>
      <p>
        In real life, we don’t live in bunkers. We live with alarms, night shifts, exam seasons, and late-night shows. 
        Our inner 24.2-hour rhythm and the 24-hour societal cycle rarely line up perfectly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The result is what researchers call <strong>social jet lag</strong>: 
        the gap between when your body wants to sleep and when your schedule allows you to.
      </p>
      <h3>Typical pattern</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Weekdays: you wake earlier than your body prefers to reach school or work.</li>
        <li>Weekends: you “pay back” by sleeping in, sliding your clock later.</li>
        <li>Sunday night: you try to slam the system back to Monday timing in one move.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you feel like every Monday is a small, self-inflicted time zone change, you’re not wrong.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Light as a steering wheel</h2>
      <p>
        The good news: the clock is flexible. Light can shift it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Specialised cells in the retina send data directly to the SCN. They don’t care about shapes or colors. 
        They care about brightness, especially blue-enriched light. Rough guide:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Light in the early morning:</strong> tends to shift your clock earlier (advance).</li>
        <li><strong>Light late at night:</strong> tends to shift it later (delay).</li>
        <li><strong>Light in the day:</strong> reinforces amplitude — a stronger, clearer rhythm.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This is why a bright walk outside at 8 a.m. can feel like a strong espresso, and why staring at a phone at 1 a.m. makes “just one more video” keep turning into “how is it 3 a.m. already?”
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The daily levers you’re already pulling</h2>
      <p>
        Even if you’ve never heard of the SCN, you are doing chronobiology experiments every day. 
        Five levers matter most for your 24.2-hour system:
      </p>
      <table class="table">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Lever</th>
            <th>Early in the day</th>
            <th>Late in the day</th>
            <th>Clock effect (simple view)</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Light</td>
            <td>Bright outdoor light anchors and shifts earlier.</td>
            <td>Bright screens push later, reduce melatonin.</td>
            <td>Strongest single cue; treat with care.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Caffeine</td>
            <td>Helps alertness if sleep is adequate.</td>
            <td>Can delay sleep onset if too close to bed.</td>
            <td>Doesn’t move clock directly, but chops sleep.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Exercise</td>
            <td>Day-time movement supports stronger rhythm.</td>
            <td>Very late intense workouts can delay some people.</td>
            <td>Acts like a “rhythm amplifier.”</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Food timing</td>
            <td>Breakfast/lunch guide peripheral clocks.</td>
            <td>Heavy late dinners confuse signal.</td>
            <td>Important for metabolism, liver, gut timing.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Social cues</td>
            <td>Regular routines stabilize cycles.</td>
            <td>Random schedules fragment them.</td>
            <td>“When others are awake” is a subtle but real cue.</td>
          </tr>

      <h2>Why 24.2 can feel unfair</h2>
      <p>
        Not everyone experiences the same drift. Genetic variants, age, and geography all shape how your 24.2-ish clock behaves.
      </p>
      <h3>Larks vs owls</h3>
      <p>
        Some people wake naturally at 5 a.m. and feel sleepy at 9 p.m. Others wake at 10 a.m. and come alive at midnight. 
        Both groups live in a world that schedules exams, office meetings, and flights at one fixed time.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your inner day is closer to 24.4 hours, every early morning is a slight upstream swim. Over years, that chronic mis-alignment shows up in mood, performance, and health statistics.
      </p>
      <h3>Teenagers and the phase-delayed brain</h3>
      <p>
        During adolescence, the body clock naturally shifts later. Teenagers aren’t just “lazy”; their biology is asking for a later sleep window. 
        Add late-night screens, and their 24.2 can quickly feel like 25.
      </p>
      <p>
        Early school start times then compress sleep, turning a biological nudge into a structural handicap.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What this means for how you feel tomorrow morning</h2>
      <p>
        Chronobiology can sound abstract until you translate it into the scene most people know intimately:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        Sunday night, 11:47 p.m. You’re scrolling, “just winding down.”  
        The alarm is set for 7:00 a.m.  
        Your body, still on Friday–Saturday timing, thinks it’s 9:30 p.m. internal time.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        You fall asleep late. You cut into the rich early cycles your brain uses for restoration. You wake up in the dark, 
        hit snooze twice, and need two coffees to feel normal by noon.
      </p>
      <p>
        None of this is a moral failing. It’s a negotiation: one inner clock, one outer world, and a lot of blue light.
      </p>
    </section>

      <h2>Simple experiments with your own clock</h2>
      <p>
        You don’t need a lab to see your 24.2 in action. A few low-tech experiments:
      </p>
      <div class="grid">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>1. The light-walk test</h3>
          <p>
            For one week, get 15–20 minutes of outdoor light within an hour of waking. No sunglasses if safe, no phone. 
            Notice whether your sleepiness shifts earlier by the weekend.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>2. The screen sunset</h3>
          <p>
            For three nights, set a “device sunset” 60–90 minutes before bed. Use dim, warm light, paper, or audio instead. 
            Watch what happens to sleep onset and how you feel the next day.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>3. The anchor wake-time</h3>
          <p>
            Pick one wake-time you can hold for 7 days (even weekends). Don’t obsess over bedtime; let it adjust. 
            See whether your energy levels stabilize by day four or five.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Long-term stakes: not just about feeling “off”</h2>
      <p>
        Chronically living out of sync with your clock isn’t just about grumpy mornings. 
        Large-scale studies link long-term circadian disruption — shift work, rotating schedules, bright nights — with higher risks of metabolic disease, mood disorders, and some cancers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The science is still evolving, but the signal is clear: your body cares deeply about when things happen, not only what happens.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The 24.2 insight, in one line</h2>
      <p>
        The world runs on exact hours and minutes. Your body doesn’t. It runs on waves.
      </p>
      <p class="callout">
        <strong>Takeaway:</strong> You don’t need a perfect routine. You just need one or two anchors — morning light, a steady wake-time — 
        doing for your 24.2-hour clock what sunrise did long before clocks existed.
