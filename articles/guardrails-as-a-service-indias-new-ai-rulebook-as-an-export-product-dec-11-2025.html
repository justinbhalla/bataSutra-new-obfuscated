    <div class="sub">
      India’s AI Governance Guidelines 2025 lay out seven principles, a tiered risk ladder and a playbook for testing, audits and red lines. 
      Read one way, they are a domestic policy. Read another way, they are a packaged service: “Here is a starter template for running AI safely — feel free to copy, tweak and host locally.”

  <h2>The short</h2>
  <div class="callout">
    <ul>
      <li>The government has released <strong>India AI Governance Guidelines 2025</strong> under the IndiaAI Mission — a non-binding but detailed blueprint for safe, inclusive and accountable AI use.</li>
      <li>The document sets out <strong>seven core principles</strong> (think fairness, accountability, safety, inclusion, transparency, privacy and resilience) plus a <strong>risk ladder</strong> that ranks systems from low to “unacceptable.”</li>
      <li>Instead of a rigid statute, the text reads like a <strong>configurable framework</strong>: agencies and firms are invited to slot their own use-cases into risk tiers and pick suitable controls from a menu.</li>
      <li>States, regulators, banks, hospitals and startups can all treat this as a <strong>common baseline</strong>, rather than reinventing their own checklists from scratch.</li>
      <li>If it works in practice, the “India AI rulebook” could turn into an <strong>exportable model</strong> for other emerging economies that want rules but lack capacity to draft them from zero.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>What sits inside the new guidelines</h2>
  <p>
    The guidelines are not a classic Act with penalties and sections. 
    They are closer to a structured handbook with four layers:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Principles:</strong> broad commitments around human-centric design, non-discrimination, safety, privacy, transparency and contestability.</li>
    <li><strong>Lifecycle duties:</strong> expectations for <em>design, training, deployment and monitoring</em>, rather than treating launch as the finish line.</li>
    <li><strong>Risk tiers:</strong> a ladder from low-risk tools (spellcheckers, basic analytics) up to high-risk systems (scoring citizens, credit, hiring, medical decisions) and a class of uses that should simply not exist.</li>
    <li><strong>Assurance tools:</strong> references to bias testing, impact assessments, audits, red-teaming, logging and incident reporting.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The text does not ban specific models. 
    It asks: <em>what is this system used for, who could it hurt, and what guardrails are proportional to that risk?</em>
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Why this feels like a product, not just a policy PDF</h2>
  <p>
    Most rulebooks are dense documents that sit on shelves. 
    This one is written to be <strong>implemented</strong>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>It invites ministries, state governments and regulators to <strong>map their own AI uses</strong> into risk tiers.</li>
    <li>It encourages firms to <strong>re-use common templates</strong> for impact assessments, logs and public disclosures.</li>
    <li>It leaves space for <strong>sector-specific add-ons</strong>: health, finance, mobility, education and advertising can layer extra checks on top.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In other words, the guidelines behave like an open-source package: a shared core with hooks for extra modules, patches and local flavours.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>What this changes for founders and product teams</h2>
  <p>
    If you build or deploy AI in India, this is not optional reading. 
    Even before it becomes binding in specific sectors, it will shape RFPs, diligence checklists and board conversations.
  </p>
  <p>
    At minimum, expect four new questions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>“Which tier are we in?”</strong>  
      You will be expected to argue why a system is low, moderate or high risk — and show your working.</li>
    <li><strong>“Where is the human hand?”</strong>  
      High-impact uses will need clear human oversight and override paths, not just a slide that says “human-in-the-loop.”</li>
    <li><strong>“What tests did you run?”</strong>  
      Bias checks, robustness tests and red-team exercises need to be written up, not waved away as internal magic.</li>
    <li><strong>“What happens when things break?”</strong>  
      Incident response, rollback plans and user-notification flows become part of the pitch, not a footnote.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Teams that can answer these crisply will stand apart from those still shipping features on vibes.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>How states, regulators and public bodies might use it</h2>
  <p>
    The guidelines are also a relief for overloaded departments that know they must “do something on AI” but lack specialist staff.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>States</strong> can declare that any algorithm used for welfare, policing or citizen scoring must meet at least a defined risk tier and pass an impact check.</li>
    <li><strong>Sector regulators</strong> can embed the framework into existing norms, from lending and insurance to securities and health.</li>
    <li><strong>Public procurement teams</strong> can ask vendors to self-classify their AI systems and attach proof of testing before contracts are signed.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Instead of twenty different templates, India gets a shared language: <em>risk tier, principle, control.</em>
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Can this turn into an export model?</h2>
  <p>
    Many countries want AI rules but do not have the resources of Brussels or Washington. 
    They need something that:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>acknowledges local values,</li>
    <li>keeps room for innovation, and</li>
    <li>comes with worked examples.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    A risk-based guideline from a large, noisy democracy with strong digital rails is a good candidate. 
    It can travel in three ways:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Regional clubs</strong> in South Asia and Africa can adapt it rather than drafting from a blank page.</li>
    <li><strong>Multinationals</strong> can treat “India-compliant AI” as a quality badge when selling to other jurisdictions.</li>
    <li><strong>Local firms</strong> can position themselves as <em>AI guardrail providers</em> — helping others implement the checklists in practice.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    That is what turns a policy into a soft export: not just words on paper, but playbooks you can pick up and run with.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Rule — one question to ask before you ship your next model</h2>
  <p>
    A compact filter for founders, product leads and engineers:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    “If this system were on a government tender tomorrow, could we explain its risk tier, tests and fallback plan in two clear pages — using the language of the India AI guidelines, not our own buzzwords?”
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    If the answer is no, treat the guidelines as more than a PDF. 
    Treat them as the spec your next serious customer will quietly mark you against.
