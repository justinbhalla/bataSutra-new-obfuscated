    <div class="sub">
      Small organisations break loudly.
      Large ones erode quietly.
      By the time failure becomes visible, recovery is already expensive.

<h2>The short</h2>
<div class="callout">
<ul>
<li><strong>Reality:</strong> Scale delays feedback.</li>
<li><strong>Illusion:</strong> Stability masks deterioration.</li>
<li><strong>Risk:</strong> Weak signals are filtered out.</li>
<li><strong>Pattern:</strong> Failure shifts from sudden to silent.</li>
<li><strong>Lesson:</strong> Large systems fail late, not safely.</li>
</ul>

<section>
<h2>Why small organisations fail visibly</h2>
<p>
In small systems, consequences surface quickly.
</p>
<p>
A bad hire hurts immediately.
A poor decision shows up in cash flow.
A broken process interrupts work.
</p>
<p>
Failure is uncomfortable, but informative.
Feedback arrives before damage compounds.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>What scale quietly changes</h2>
<p>
As organisations grow, buffers multiply.
</p>
<ul>
<li>cash reserves,</li>
<li>layered management,</li>
<li>redundant teams,</li>
<li>and institutional credibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>
These cushions absorb stress.
They also absorb warning signs.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>How failure becomes delayed</h2>
<p>
Large systems can carry inefficiencies for years.
</p>
<p>
Underperforming units are offset by stronger ones.
Cultural decay hides behind process.
Strategic drift is masked by momentum.
</p>
<p>
The organisation appears healthy —
even as adaptability weakens.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why breakdowns feel sudden</h2>
<p>
When failure finally arrives, it looks abrupt.
</p>
<p>
But the collapse is rarely new.
It is the release of pressure that has been accumulating invisibly.
</p>
<p>
Scale does not prevent failure.
It stretches the time between cause and effect.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The leadership trap</h2>
<p>
Leaders of large organisations often mistake silence for strength.
</p>
<p>
If nothing is breaking, the assumption is that nothing is wrong.
</p>
<p>
In reality, the system may simply be too big to speak clearly.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>What resilient scale looks like</h2>
<p>
Healthy large organisations work against their own size.
</p>
<ul>
<li>They shorten feedback loops.</li>
<li>They surface weak signals early.</li>
<li>They treat small failures as data.</li>
</ul>
<p>
They design for detectability, not just efficiency.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The takeaway</h2>
<p>
Scale does not make organisations safer.
It makes their failures harder to see.
</p>
<p>
The most dangerous period for a large system is not crisis —
it is prolonged calm without scrutiny.
