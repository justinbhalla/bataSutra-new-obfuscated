    <h1>India’s AI Royalty Test: The ‘One Licence, One Payment’ Plan</h1>
    <div class="sub">
      A government panel has floated a compulsory blanket licence for AI training on copyright-protected Indian works. 
      Instead of thousands of separate deals, developers would pay into a single royalty pool; creators would be paid out from that pot. 
      It is pitched as “one nation, one licence, one payment” for the training era.

  <h2>The short</h2>
  <div class="callout">
    <ul>
      <li>A DPIIT committee has released a working paper titled <strong>“One Nation, One Licence, One Payment: Balancing AI Innovation and Copyright.”</strong> It suggests a <strong>mandatory blanket licence</strong> that lets AI developers train on all lawfully accessed protected works in exchange for royalties paid into a central pool.</li>
      <li>Rates would be set by a <strong>government-empanelled body</strong>, not by one-to-one negotiation. Creators and rights holders would gain a statutory right to remuneration but lose the power to refuse training use altogether.</li>
      <li>For Indian startups, the idea promises <strong>cleaner legal ground</strong> and fewer takedown threats: pay the levy, show compliance, train on broad Indian datasets without chasing individual signatures.</li>
      <li>For creators, the upside is <strong>fresh income streams</strong> and a structured way to get paid when AI systems rely on their work. The downside: worries that rates end up low, opaque or skewed towards bigger players.</li>
      <li>For global giants, the scheme looks like a <strong>territorial AI tax</strong> layered on top of existing compliance, and it may clash with “fair use” and opt-out regimes in other regions.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>What is actually on the table?</h2>
  <p>
    The committee’s paper does not ban AI training on copyrighted Indian works. Instead, it treats such use as allowed—but only through a compulsory licence that comes with fees and rules.
  </p>
  <p>
    In plain language, the draft regime would:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Create a single national licence</strong> that covers books, journalism, films, audio, images and other protected content, as long as the AI developer accessed them lawfully.</li>
    <li><strong>Replace case-by-case deals</strong> with centrally set tariffs, a bit like statutory music licences or compulsory radio royalties.</li>
    <li><strong>Channel payments into one or more collection societies</strong> or a similar entity, which would then distribute money to authors, publishers, studios and other rights holders under agreed formulas.</li>
    <li><strong>Remove “consent” as a control point</strong> for training: creators would not be able to say “no” to training use, only to argue about how the money gets split or how uses are tracked.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Crucially, this is still a <strong>working paper</strong>. Stakeholders have about a month to file responses. Parliament has not voted; no notification has been issued. But as a signal of direction, it is loud.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Why small labs and startups might cheer</h2>
  <p>
    Today, any Indian company that trains or fine-tunes models on scraped content lives in a legal grey zone. 
    Global firms argue that training is a technical use covered by “fair use” or text-and-data-mining exceptions; many creators disagree; courts have not settled the question.
  </p>
  <p>
    A blanket licence does three things for smaller builders:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Predictable risk:</strong> pay the fee, follow reporting rules and you are broadly safe from sudden takedown notices for training runs that used Indian works.</li>
    <li><strong>Cheaper access to scale:</strong> instead of paying premium rates to a few closed data vendors, labs could train on large Indian corpora—regional languages, local news, entertainment—under one scheme.</li>
    <li><strong>Better fund-raising story:</strong> investors like clean compliance. “We are covered under the national AI licence” is easier to explain than “we scraped a lot and hope it’s fine.”</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In effect, the state is saying: “We will sell you a legal umbrella. Use it, and stop pretending it is not raining lawsuits elsewhere.”
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>What creators stand to gain—and worry about</h2>
  <p>
    On the other side, the proposal tries to answer a basic grievance: 
    content that cost years of effort is feeding US- and EU-built systems without clear payment or credit.
  </p>
  <p>
    The upside for authors, journalists, studios and labels:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>New revenue streams</strong> beyond ads, subscriptions and syndication, especially for large back catalogues that still have training value.</li>
    <li><strong>Less litigation stress:</strong> instead of chasing individual AI firms across borders, rights holders would focus on influencing national tariffs and splits.</li>
    <li><strong>Stronger voice in data debates:</strong> once payouts exist, creators’ groups gain an obvious seat at any “IndiaAI” table that decides rates and scope.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The anxieties are equally clear:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Low per-work payouts:</strong> if the pool is large but divided across millions of works, each book or article could see tiny returns.</li>
    <li><strong>Opaque allocation:</strong> without transparent reporting and independent audits, smaller creators fear their share will vanish into admin and top-heavy splits.</li>
    <li><strong>No veto power:</strong> some may simply not want their work used in training at all; the scheme gives them money, not that choice.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In other words: the regime promises fairness at aggregate level, but may feel blunt at the level of a single poem or independent film.
  </p>

  <h2>Unanswered questions for anyone building with AI in India</h2>
  <p>
    Even if you like the idea in principle, the details matter far more than the slogan on the cover page. 
    A few unresolved questions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Scope:</strong> does the licence cover only training, or also synthetic output that closely copies specific works? Where does “inspiration” turn into “derivative”?</li>
    <li><strong>Territory:</strong> does the obligation apply to any AI used in India, any AI trained inside India, or any AI that <em>touches</em> Indian works, even if the training run happened on foreign servers?</li>
    <li><strong>Rate setting:</strong> will tariffs be flat, tied to compute usage, tied to revenue, or some hybrid? Are there discounts for research, open-source models or non-profit labs?</li>
    <li><strong>Reporting:</strong> what logs must teams keep—datasets, checkpoints, prompts, only broad summaries? How intrusive would audits be for small firms?</li>
    <li><strong>Compatibility with global regimes:</strong> how does a compulsory Indian licence interact with US fair-use arguments, EU opt-out lists and Japanese “train on anything” rules?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Until those edges sharpen, the scheme is an outline, not a full contract.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>How to think about it if you run an AI product in India</h2>
  <p>
    If you are a founder, counsel, or lead engineer, you do not need to become a copyright scholar overnight. 
    You do need a crisp internal stance. A practical way to frame it:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Inventory first:</strong> write down what data you use today—open licences, proprietary feeds, scraped sources, customer uploads.</li>
    <li><strong>Classify risk:</strong> separate clearly licensed or in-house material from grey-zone scraped sets that include Indian books, news, cinema or songs.</li>
    <li><strong>Budget for a levy:</strong> assume some portion of future spend goes to a national licence, whether you like it or not. Treat it like cloud bills: part of the stack.</li>
    <li><strong>Engage, don’t just complain:</strong> trade bodies, developer groups and creator collectives will all lobby on rates and rules. If you ignore that stage, you live with whatever others negotiate.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Most importantly, resist the instinct to assume “nothing will happen.” 
    India rarely writes a working paper like this for fun; it signals where the Overton window now sits.
  </p>

  <h2>Rule — a simple mental checkpoint for this reform</h2>
  <p>
    A compact rule of thumb for Indian AI builders:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    “If your system learns from Indian copyrighted works, plan as if a national licence and royalty tab already exist—and treat today’s lower-friction world as a temporary discount, not a right.”
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    That mindset won’t answer every legal question. 
    It will, however, keep you from making long-term bets on a loophole that policy is explicitly trying to close.
