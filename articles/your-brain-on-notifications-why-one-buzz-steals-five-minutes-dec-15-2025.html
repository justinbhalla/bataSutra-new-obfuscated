        <div class="callout">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Core idea:</strong> Interruptions don’t just break time—they break the mental “shape” of a task.</li>
            <li><strong>Hidden cost:</strong> Your brain pays a restart fee: context rebuilding, goal reloading, and error checking.</li>
            <li><strong>Why it feels fine:</strong> You remember the notification, not the lost thread.</li>
            <li><strong>Why it feels awful later:</strong> The day becomes “busy” without producing anything you can point to.</li>

        <h2>A tiny buzz, a big spill</h2>
        <p>
          Imagine carrying a glass of water across a room. A notification is someone tapping your elbow.
          You don’t drop the glass. You don’t fall. You barely flinch.
        </p>
        <p>
          But a little water spills. You keep walking anyway—until you reach the end and realize your shirt is wet.
          That’s the day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notifications are not catastrophic. That’s why they’re dangerous.
          They are small enough to ignore, frequent enough to accumulate, and designed to feel harmless.
          A short glance becomes a slow leak that turns focus into fog.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>What your brain is doing when you “focus”</h2>
        <p>
          Focus is not a single thing. It’s a stack.
        </p>

        <div class="grid">
          <div class="card half">
            <h3>1) The goal</h3>
            <p>
              “What am I trying to do right now?” Write a paragraph. Solve a problem. Read carefully.
              The goal is the steering wheel.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="card half">
            <h3>2) The context</h3>
            <p>
              The background state: where you left off, what you decided two minutes ago, what you’re avoiding.
              Context is the map.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="card half">
            <h3>3) The working memory</h3>
            <p>
              The temporary scratchpad: names, numbers, next steps, half-formed sentences.
              This is fragile by design.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="card half">
            <h3>4) The error-check loop</h3>
            <p>
              The quiet system that asks: “Am I still on track?” It catches mistakes—until it’s overloaded.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          A notification disrupts all four layers at once. Even if you don’t open it, your brain still registers
          “something else is happening.” That alone can shake the stack.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>The restart fee (why 10 seconds becomes minutes)</h2>
        <p>
          The frustration isn’t the interruption—it’s the recovery.
          After you glance away, the brain does a small sequence that feels like nothing but consumes real attention.
        </p>

        <table class="table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Step</th>
              <th>What it feels like</th>
              <th>What the brain is doing</th>
              <th>Where errors creep in</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Re-entry</strong></td>
              <td>“Okay… where was I?”</td>
              <td>Reloads the goal + locates the last stable point</td>
              <td>You restart from the wrong point</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Rebuild</strong></td>
              <td>“Right, and then…”</td>
              <td>Reconstructs the context chain</td>
              <td>You skip a dependency or assumption</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Recommit</strong></td>
              <td>“Let’s do this.”</td>
              <td>Suppresses competing thoughts + re-locks attention</td>
              <td>Competing thoughts keep leaking in</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Quality check</strong></td>
              <td>“Does this still make sense?”</td>
              <td>Runs quick consistency checks</td>
              <td>Typos, logic gaps, repeated work</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>
          This is why people say they “worked all day” and still feel empty at night.
          The hours weren’t stolen by one big distraction. They were sold off in tiny restart fees.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Why it’s worse than you think: the “open loop” effect</h2>
        <p>
          A notification creates an open loop: a question without closure.
          “Who messaged me?” “Is this urgent?” “Did something happen?”
          Even if you don’t check, the loop stays warm in your mind like a tab you forgot to close.
        </p>
        <p>
          Open loops pull attention because the brain dislikes unfinished stories.
          That tension is not weakness—it’s normal cognition.
          Platforms simply learned how to trigger it on demand.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <p><strong>Plain English:</strong> Notifications turn your brain into a customer support desk.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Why some notifications hit harder than others</h2>
        <p>
          Not all buzzes are equal. The brain prioritizes signals that might change social standing, safety, or identity.
          That’s why you can ignore a battery alert but instantly reach for a message preview.
        </p>

        <div class="grid">
          <div class="card half">
            <h3>Social signals</h3>
            <p>
              Messages, mentions, comments. These carry status: approval, conflict, belonging.
              They hijack attention because humans are wired for tribe cues.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="card half">
            <h3>Uncertainty signals</h3>
            <p>
              Vague alerts with no detail. They force you to check to resolve ambiguity.
              Curiosity isn’t an accident—it’s a lever.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="card half">
            <h3>Loss signals</h3>
            <p>
              “Price dropped.” “Offer expires.” “Last chance.”
              Fear of missing out is an efficient button.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="card half">
            <h3>Identity signals</h3>
            <p>
              Anything that says “your account,” “your photos,” “your security.”
              The brain jumps because the stakes feel personal.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

      <section>
        <h2>The quiet health angle: fatigue, not discipline</h2>
        <p>
          The common story is discipline: “Just don’t check.”
          But there’s a more honest story: fatigue.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you are fresh, you can ignore a buzz. When you are tired, the buzz feels like a permission slip:
          a small escape hatch from effort. That’s not laziness—it’s the brain seeking lower-cost tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is why notification overload often shows up alongside poor sleep and stress.
          The device isn’t creating all the exhaustion, but it is converting exhaustion into fragmentation.
          It turns “low energy” into “scattered day.”
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>The business layer: why the phone wants to be a slot machine</h2>
        <p>
          Notifications are not only communication. They’re distribution.
          Each ping is a chance to pull you back into an app, refresh the feed, show an ad, or trigger a purchase.
        </p>
        <p>
          The economics reward frequency. If a company can raise daily opens, it raises ad inventory.
          If it can raise sessions, it raises revenue opportunities.
          “Engagement” is the polite label. “Interruption” is the human label.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is also why the newest phone features increasingly treat quiet as a default:
          people aren’t asking for better notifications—they’re asking for fewer.
          Attention has become the scarce resource, and users now defend it like money.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>What to watch next</h2>
        <div class="callout">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Default quiet settings:</strong> phones that start muted and ask you to opt in to noise.</li>
            <li><strong>Bundled “digest” alerts:</strong> fewer pings, more summaries at set times.</li>
            <li><strong>Priority lanes:</strong> small lists of people or apps that can break through.</li>
            <li><strong>Wearable nudges:</strong> calmer taps replacing bright screens—less stimulation, same signal.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>The rule:</strong> Count “restarts,” not minutes. If you restart a task more than a few times per hour, the day will feel full and still end unfinished.</p>
