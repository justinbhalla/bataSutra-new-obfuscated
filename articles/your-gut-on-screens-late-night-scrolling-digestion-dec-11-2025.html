      You blame the 2 a.m. snack. Science has a harsher suspect: the glare, drama, and blue light that drag your brain — and gut —
      out of their night shift. The feed you scroll can tug on hormones, hunger, and even gut-bacteria timing.

      <h2>The short</h2>
      <div class="callout">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Clock clash:</strong> Your gut follows a daily rhythm set by light, food, and sleep. Late screens scramble that timing.</li>
          <li><strong>Hormone nudge:</strong> Experiments show that shifting light and eating late can tilt hunger hormones toward “eat more” the next day.</li>
          <li><strong>Gut rhythm:</strong> Digestive activity and even some gut-bacteria patterns sync to when you sleep and wake, not just what you eat.</li>
          <li><strong>Key idea:</strong> The scroll itself matters — alert, emotional content keeps stress circuits humming when your gut wants to power down.</li>
          <li><strong>Watch:</strong> How long you scroll in the last hour before sleep; that window carries outsized weight for next-day cravings and comfort.</li>

      <h2>Your gut has a clock — not just a menu</h2>
      <p>
        Most of us think of the gut as a tube that reacts to whatever we throw at it: good snacks, bad snacks, heroic amounts
        of festival food. In reality, the gut runs on a timetable. Cells lining the intestine, liver, and pancreas switch
        between “day shift” and “night shift” — changing how they absorb, burn, and store energy over 24 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
        That timetable is wired to the same master clock in the brain that responds to light. When it’s bright and you’re active,
        digestion runs hotter. As night sets in, hormones and nerve signals tell the gut to slow, repair, and clean up. 
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        In a well-aligned life, light, food, and sleep tell the same story: “day” and “night.” Late-night screens make those
        narrators argue.

      <h2>What late-night light does before you even touch a snack</h2>
      <p>
        Bright blue-heavy light from phones, tablets, and laptops is rocket fuel for waking circuits. Controlled lab studies show
        that light exposure in the late evening can suppress melatonin, delay the onset of sleepiness, and push the circadian
        clock later into the night.
      </p>
      <p>
        When your internal clock is nudged later over and over, three things start to slide:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sleep drifts later</strong> and often gets shorter, especially if your alarm time is fixed by work or school.</li>
        <li><strong>Cortisol and other stress signals stay elevated</strong> when they should be gliding down.</li>
        <li><strong>Gut activity gets re-timed</strong> toward later hours, which clashes with how your body evolved to handle food.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The net effect: your brain says “day” while your digestive system is halfway into “night,” and the gut gets mixed orders
        on whether to digest, repair, or just rest.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>From doomscroll to fridge door: the hormone story</h2>
      <p>
        Researchers who deliberately shifted people’s sleep and eating schedules — or made them eat late at night — keep seeing 
        similar patterns: when circadian timing slips, hunger signals creep up and satiety signals drop.
      </p>
      <p>
        In several controlled feeding studies, late eating has been linked with:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Higher levels of ghrelin, the hormone that tells you “you’re hungry.”</li>
        <li>Lower levels of leptin, which normally says “you’re full now.”</li>
        <li>Changes in GLP-1 and insulin signalling that nudge the body toward storing rather than burning energy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The key point: those shifts can show up even when total calories and meals are the same, but eaten later and under
        disrupted light/sleep schedules. It isn’t just the cookie — it’s <em>when</em> your brain and gut receive the cookie.

      <h2>The gut microbiome angle (and what we know so far)</h2>
      <p>
        Over the last few years, researchers have asked a new question: does irregular sleep and late-night living actually
        change the gut bacteria landscape itself?
      </p>
      <p>
        Early work suggests:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>People with “social jetlag” — big gaps between weekday and weekend sleep times — can show different gut-bacteria patterns than those with regular schedules.</li>
        <li>Shift-workers often have altered metabolic profiles and, in some studies, different microbiome signatures compared to day-workers.</li>
        <li>Animal experiments, where light/dark cycles are forcibly shifted, clearly show that gut bacteria follow the clock as well.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Human microbiome science is noisy and still evolving, so it’s too early to say “your phone rewired your gut flora.”
        But the direction of travel is clear: when your brain’s clock is out of sync, your gut’s social life is too.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>It’s not just light — it’s what you scroll</h2>
      <p>
        Light is only half the story. Content is the other. Your gut is wired to your brain through a highway of nerves and
        hormones. When a late-night scroll is calm — reading, slow videos, low drama — your system adjusts differently than when
        you’re hit with crisis clips, arguments, or high-stakes news.
      </p>
      <div class="grid">
        <div class="card half">
          <h3>High-arousal feeds</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Fast cuts, outrage, scary news, endless notifications.</li>
            <li>Keeps sympathetic (“fight-or-flight”) circuits high.</li>
            <li>Slows digestion, tightens gut muscles, raises heart rate.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="card half">
          <h3>Low-arousal feeds</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Slow cooking videos, cosy vlogs, quiet reading apps.</li>
            <li>Less sympathetic surge; easier glide into sleep.</li>
            <li>Less direct disruption to gut-relaxation signals.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        You can think of your late-night feed as a menu of stress snacks. Some are spicy, some are bland — but they all arrive
        at a time when your gut wanted fewer surprises.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Everyday scenarios you already recognise</h2>
      <h3>“I wake up bloated after Netflix nights”</h3>
      <p>
        Long series binges push bedtime later, often include late snacks, and compress deep sleep. Your gut gets less time in
        its “repair and move things along” mode, so next-day heaviness is partly bookkeeping delay.
      </p>

      <h3>“I barely eat lunch but inhale dinner and dessert”</h3>
      <p>
        Scattered days and heavy screen evenings tilt hunger to the back half of the day. Hormone timing shifts mean you may
        feel numb during daylight and ravenous in front of a screen at night.
      </p>

      <h3>“Weekdays and weekends feel like two different bodies”</h3>
      <p>
        Late-night scrolling on Fridays and Saturdays followed by catch-up sleep on Sundays creates mini jetlag loops. Your gut
        never quite knows what “morning” or “evening” is supposed to be.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Small dials, not giant overhauls</h2>
      <p>
        The point of this science isn’t to shame every bedtime scroll. It’s to show how <strong>small, repeated shifts</strong> add up:
        ten minutes of extra screen time here, one more episode there, “just a quick look” at a notification. The gut doesn’t
        revolt in one night; it drifts over weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tiny adjustments can work in your favour:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Anchor one “screen-quiet” hour:</strong> pick a consistent cutoff most days, even if it’s not perfect.</li>
        <li><strong>Switch the content texture:</strong> calmer, slower feeds in the last 20–30 minutes instead of crisis-scrolling.</li>
        <li><strong>Move the snack earlier:</strong> if you’re going to snack, doing it an hour or two earlier gives your gut more runway.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Rule of thumb — the scroll–stomach link</h2>
      <div class="callout">
        <p class="badge">One simple rule</p>
        <p>
          Treat the last <strong>hour before sleep</strong> as shared territory between your brain and your gut. What your eyes watch and
          fingers scroll in that window quietly sets the tone for hunger, cravings, and comfort the next day.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want a quick self-check: for one week, note <strong>two things</strong> every morning — “How late did I scroll?” and
          “How does my stomach feel?” The pattern that emerges is your personal biology, not a generic tip.
