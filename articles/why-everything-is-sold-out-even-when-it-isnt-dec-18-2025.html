  <h2>The short</h2>
  <div class="callout">
    <ul>
      <li>“Sold out” increasingly signals urgency, not absence.</li>
      <li>Retail interfaces now shape demand more than inventory limits.</li>
      <li>Waitlists, soft locks, and delayed restocks stretch desire.</li>
      <li>Consumers read scarcity as quality, relevance, and social proof.</li>
      <li>True shortages behave differently — and leave clear traces.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>When absence became persuasive</h2>
  <p>
    A page refreshes. Color options fade. Size M disappears.  
    Nothing feels accidental — yet nothing confirms reality either.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over recent years, retail quietly crossed a line. Scarcity stopped reflecting warehouse constraints and started shaping emotion. “Unavailable” no longer means gone. It means paused, withheld, or strategically delayed.
  </p>
  <p>
    In fashion, beauty, food drops, even grocery apps, limited availability now performs a role once reserved for advertising. It creates momentum without promising delivery.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Scarcity moved from logistics to interface</h2>
  <p>
    Earlier retail cycles fought empty shelves. Current systems engineer them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Algorithms throttle supply on purpose: releasing stock in waves, limiting visible quantities, or hiding replenishment timing. Each tactic buys attention without cutting prices.
  </p>
  <p>
    What matters is not what exists, but what appears reachable at a given moment.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>How “sold out” actually works now</h2>
  <table class="table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Signal shown</th>
        <th>What is happening underneath</th>
        <th>Why it works</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Low stock banner</td>
        <td>Visibility cap, not stock cap</td>
        <td>Triggers urgency bias</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Waitlist button</td>
        <td>Delayed release queue</td>
        <td>Turns interest into commitment</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Greyed variant</td>
        <td>Artificial constraint</td>
        <td>Frames available options as “chosen”</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Restock alert</td>
        <td>Batch drop scheduling</td>
        <td>Creates appointment shopping</td>
      </tr>

<section>
  <h2>Why scarcity feels safer than abundance</h2>
  <p>
    Choice overload exhausts. Scarcity simplifies.
  </p>
  <p>
    When options vanish, decision pressure drops. What remains feels approved — almost curated. This is why limited menus outperform endless aisles, and why “only one left” calms doubt rather than increasing it.
  </p>
  <p>
    In uncertain economies, scarcity reads as stability. If something sells out, someone else validated it already.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The emotional cost</h2>
  <p>
    Repeated exposure to false scarcity changes behavior. Shoppers rush. Returns rise. Regret follows.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over time, trust erodes. Once users recognize artificial limits, urgency flips into suspicion.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The tell that separates real shortages from designed ones</h2>
  <div class="callout">
    <p>
      <strong>Real scarcity leaks information.</strong>  
      Production delays, shipping notes, staggered regional impact.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Designed scarcity stays silent.</strong>  
      No timelines. No explanations. Just repeated urgency cues.
    </p>
  </div>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Bottom line</h2>
  <p>
    “Sold out” once described reality. Now it describes intent.
  </p>
  <p>
    Modern retail sells absence as efficiently as products. Knowing difference protects attention, wallet, and patience.
