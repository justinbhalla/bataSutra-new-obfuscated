    <h1>From Growth to Endurance: How Companies Reprice Risk After Volatility</h1>
    <div class="sub">
      The last decade rewarded speed, scale, and confidence.  
      The next one rewards something quieter: the ability to survive uncertainty without losing shape.
      Companies are no longer chasing growth blindly — they are repricing risk itself.

<h2>The short</h2>
<div class="callout">
<ul>
<li><strong>Shift:</strong> Firms are moving from growth-first to endurance-first thinking.</li>
<li><strong>Reason:</strong> Volatility exposed the true cost of fragile expansion.</li>
<li><strong>Change:</strong> Risk is no longer avoided — it is priced more honestly.</li>
<li><strong>Signal:</strong> Balance sheets and execution matter more than narratives.</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Endurance now commands a premium.</li>
</ul>

<section>
<h2>Why growth stopped feeling safe</h2>
<p>
For years, growth was treated as protection.
Scale promised resilience. Expansion promised optionality.
</p>
<p>
Volatility broke that illusion.
Companies that grew fastest often discovered they had also grown weakest —
dependent on cheap capital, fragile supply chains, and optimistic assumptions.
</p>
<p>
Growth didn’t disappear.
Its meaning changed.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Risk didn’t increase — it became visible</h2>
<p>
Executives often say risk has risen.
In reality, risk was always present.
What changed was visibility.
</p>
<p>
Interest rates rose. Currency moved. Demand wavered.
Suddenly, assumptions that once felt safe became explicit liabilities.
</p>
<p>
The lesson was not to avoid risk — but to understand its cost.
</p>

<p>
Risk is now modelled, discussed, and priced — not hand-waved away.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>What endurance actually looks like</h2>
<p>
Endurance is not conservatism.
It is operational realism.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Moderate leverage instead of maximum leverage.</li>
<li>Selective expansion instead of blanket growth.</li>
<li>Redundancy instead of single points of failure.</li>
<li>Clear communication instead of confident silence.</li>
</ul>
<p>
These choices rarely excite markets in the short term.
They outperform over time.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The cultural shift inside organisations</h2>
<p>
This repricing of risk changes how companies behave internally.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Heroic execution gives way to repeatable process.</li>
<li>Targets become ranges, not absolutes.</li>
<li>Bad news travels faster, not slower.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Endurance cultures reward judgment, not bravado.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The takeaway</h2>
<p>
Growth still matters.
But endurance decides who gets to grow again.
</p>
<p>
The strongest companies in this cycle will not be the fastest.
They will be the ones still intact when conditions change — again.
