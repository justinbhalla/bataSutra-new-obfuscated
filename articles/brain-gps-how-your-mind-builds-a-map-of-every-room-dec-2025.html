      You don’t just “see” a room. You translate it into a map — a silent sketch of edges, anchors, and safe routes.
      And when that mapping fails, the space can feel wrong even if nothing bad is happening.

          <li><strong>Your brain maps space automatically:</strong> specialized cells track where you are and where you’re going.</li>

      <h2>The strange feeling: “This room is fine… so why am I tense?”</h2>
      <p>
        You’ve felt it in a hotel corridor, an unfamiliar office, a new apartment, even a fancy café:
        the space looks normal, but your body is slightly on guard.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your eyes scan. Your shoulders stay a bit tight. You choose a seat that lets you see the entrance.
        You don’t announce this as a decision — you just do it.
      </p>
      <p>
        That sensation is your navigation brain doing a job you didn’t ask for:
        building a map, testing the map, and checking if the map is reliable.
      </p>
      <p>
        We call it “Brain GPS” because that’s the easiest metaphor. But the truth is more intimate:
        <strong>your brain is constantly asking: do I understand this space well enough to relax?</strong>
      </p>
    </section>

      <h2>The brain’s mapping crew (in plain language)</h2>
      <p>
        Deep inside your brain are systems that keep track of location, distance, and direction. You don’t “think” them on.
        They run like background processes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scientists describe a few key players:
      </p>

      <div class="grid">
        <div class="card third">
          <p class="badge">Player</p>
          <h3>Place signals</h3>
          <p>
            Neurons that fire when you’re in a specific spot. Think of them like “this corner feels like here.”
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card third">
          <p class="badge">Player</p>
          <h3>Grid signals</h3>
          <p>
            A repeating internal coordinate pattern that helps you track movement and distance, even in new places.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card third">
          <p class="badge">Player</p>
          <h3>Border signals</h3>
          <p>
            Neurons that respond to edges — walls, boundaries, the line where space stops being safe and defined.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        The details are complex in labs. But the feeling in real life is simple:
        when these systems get clean inputs, you feel oriented.
        When the inputs are messy, you feel slightly unsettled.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why boundaries calm the brain</h2>
      <p>
        One of the strongest cues for brain mapping is the boundary. Humans love edges: walls, corners, doorframes,
        furniture that “marks” a zone. It’s not aesthetic preference; it’s map-building preference.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s why people often choose:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>a seat against the wall</li>
        <li>a corner table</li>
        <li>a spot with a clear view of the entrance</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These choices reduce uncertainty. Your brain does less work to predict what might happen around you.
        Less work means more ease.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The cue menu: what stabilizes a mental map</h2>
      <p>
        Your brain doesn’t need a perfect blueprint. It needs a few “good hooks” to pin the map.
        Designers accidentally create these hooks all the time — and the best spaces create them on purpose.
      </p>

      <p><span class="badge">Table</span> Common cues and how they feel in your body.</p>
      <table class="table">
        <thead>

      <h2>Why some modern spaces confuse us (and then tire us out)</h2>
      <p>
        A lot of modern design accidentally removes the brain’s favorite cues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Glass walls blur boundaries. Long corridors look identical. Minimalist interiors remove anchors.
        Open offices erase “zones” so your brain can’t decide what counts as your space.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can still function — but you feel slightly drained. That’s the cost of constant low-level orientation work.
      </p>

      <div class="grid">
        <div class="card half">
          <h3>Identical corridors</h3>
          <p>
            Hotels and offices often repeat the same carpet, same doors, same lighting. Your brain tries to tag each
            segment as distinct but keeps receiving “this looks like the last one.”
            Confusion rises, even if you don’t label it as confusion.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card half">
          <h3>Open-plan overload</h3>
          <p>
            Without clear boundaries, your brain treats the space as one giant zone and keeps scanning for structure.
            That scanning steals attention — which is why “open” sometimes feels exhausting.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The screen problem: digital life breaks spatial memory</h2>
      <p>
        Here’s the weird part: your brain GPS system evolved for physical space, but modern life keeps feeding it
        environments that don’t behave like environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        A phone is not a room, yet you spend hours inside it.
        A video call is not a place, yet your social brain treats it like one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tabs, feeds, floating windows — they lack stable edges and consistent anchors. Your mind keeps “trying” to map
        them anyway. When mapping keeps failing, fatigue rises.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        That “tired but I didn’t do anything” feeling after heavy screen time can be the brain’s spatial system
        working without ever getting a stable map.
      </blockquote>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why bookstores feel like medicine</h2>
      <p>
        Bookstores and libraries often feel unusually calming. Not because books are magical — but because the space
        supports stable mapping:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>clear aisles</li>
        <li>repeatable structure (genres, shelves)</li>
        <li>soft noise</li>
        <li>strong anchors (front desk, window, feature table)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Your brain GPS locks on quickly. Once it does, attention becomes available for thinking, reading, or simply breathing.
      </p>
      <p>
        In plain words: you relax because your brain understands where you are.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The personal layer: why some people get lost more easily</h2>
      <p>
        People differ in how strongly they rely on certain cues. Some navigate by landmarks (“turn at the big tree”).
        Others navigate by geometry (“it’s two blocks north and one block right”). Some have strong internal compasses.
        Others rely on familiar routes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stress also changes navigation. When you’re anxious, your brain tends to scan for exits and threats.
        That scanning competes with map-building. You feel less oriented, even in a familiar place.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is why unfamiliar spaces can feel harder on hard days — and easier on calm days.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Practical takeaway: how to make a space feel instantly better</h2>
      <p>
        If “comfort” is partly map stability, then simple design choices can help:
      </p>
      <div class="grid">
        <div class="card half">
          <h3>At home</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Add one anchor:</strong> a lamp, art, or plant in the “main” corner.</li>
            <li><strong>Create zones:</strong> reading chair area, work desk area, eating area.</li>
            <li><strong>Reduce visual noise:</strong> fewer scattered objects makes mapping cleaner.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="card half">
          <h3>At work</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Claim a boundary:</strong> sit near a wall when possible.</li>
            <li><strong>Keep one consistent item:</strong> your bottle, notebook, or bag in the same spot.</li>
            <li><strong>Use light intentionally:</strong> harsh glare increases sensory instability.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        These are not hacks. They’re gentle ways of giving your brain what it quietly wants: clear cues.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What to watch next</h2>
      <div class="callout">
        <p class="badge">What to watch</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>VR and spatial computing design:</strong> the best digital tools will reduce fatigue by giving stable spatial cues.</li>
          <li><strong>Architecture shifting back to “cozy zones”:</strong> cafés, libraries, and offices creating clearer boundaries again.</li>
          <li><strong>Wearables measuring cognitive load:</strong> attention fatigue may be increasingly linked to orientation load, not just screen time.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Rule:</strong> if a room feels calming within 30 seconds, your brain GPS likely found clean edges + one strong anchor.</p>
