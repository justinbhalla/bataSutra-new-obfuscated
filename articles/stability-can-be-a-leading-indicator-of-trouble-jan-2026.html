    <div class="sub">
      Long periods of calm feel healthy.
      In complex systems, they often mean stress is being absorbed silently.
      Failure rarely announces itself while it is forming.

<h2>The short</h2>
<div class="callout">
<ul>
<li><strong>Assumption:</strong> Stability equals strength.</li>
<li><strong>Reality:</strong> Calm can hide accumulated strain.</li>
<li><strong>Risk:</strong> Early warnings get filtered out.</li>
<li><strong>Pattern:</strong> Failure follows long quiet periods.</li>
<li><strong>Lesson:</strong> Silence is not the same as health.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why stability feels reassuring</h2>
<p>
Stable systems are predictable.
They deliver consistent outcomes and reduce cognitive load.
</p>
<p>
Leaders learn to trust smooth operations as proof that things are under control.
Absence of disruption becomes a performance signal.
</p>
<p>
Over time, calm stops being a condition and becomes a goal.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>What stability actually does</h2>
<p>
In complex environments, stress does not disappear.
It gets redistributed.
</p>
<p>
When systems are optimised to remain smooth:
</p>
<ul>
<li>minor errors are absorbed,</li>
<li>edge cases are deferred,</li>
<li>and small signals are normalised.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The system looks stable — while tension accumulates underneath.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>How warning signals get suppressed</h2>
<p>
As stability becomes expected, deviation feels unwelcome.
</p>
<p>
Employees learn what not to surface.
Metrics smooth out anomalies.
Reporting focuses on averages, not extremes.
</p>
<p>
Signals do not disappear.
They simply stop travelling upward.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Why failure feels sudden</h2>
<p>
Highly stable systems fail abruptly.
</p>
<p>
They lack visible deterioration because slack was removed long ago.
There is no room for gradual correction.
</p>
<p>
When thresholds are crossed, collapse appears instantaneous —
even though weakening has been ongoing.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>What healthy systems tolerate</h2>
<p>
Resilient organisations are not perfectly calm.
</p>
<ul>
<li>They allow small disruptions.</li>
<li>They surface uncomfortable signals.</li>
<li>They treat noise as information.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Some instability is a sign that adaptation is still possible.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The takeaway</h2>
<p>
Stability is not proof of strength.
It is a state that must be interpreted.
</p>
<p>
In complex systems, the absence of visible problems often means
problems are being postponed — not prevented.
