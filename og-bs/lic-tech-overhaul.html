      <h1>LIC Eyes Tech Overhaul with $2B Digital Push</h1>
      <p class="article-meta">By bataSutra Staff | June 3, 2025</p>

<p>India’s Life Insurance Corporation (LIC), once synonymous with traditional insurance, is preparing for a technological leap. The behemoth is investing $2 billion in what could be one of the most ambitious digital overhauls in India’s financial services sector.</p>
<p>The plan is structured around three critical pillars: infrastructure modernization, agent enablement, and customer experience transformation.</p>

<h2>Legacy to Cloud: Core Overhaul</h2>
<p>LIC’s core systems still run on mainframes and batch-processing modules — remnants of a different era. The upgrade plan will shift these to a microservices-based, cloud-native infrastructure powered by public and hybrid cloud providers. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Infosys are in close contention for multi-year implementation contracts.</p>
<p>This foundational change will allow LIC to adopt real-time policy issuance, automated claims processing, and predictive analytics — long the domain of newer private insurers and fintechs.</p>

<h2>Empowering the Agent Network</h2>
<p>LIC has over 1.3 million agents — the world’s largest insurance sales force. However, they operate with minimal digital support. The overhaul includes launching a mobile-first CRM for agents, real-time commission dashboards, and AI-driven lead recommendations based on geography and policy history.</p>
<p>This agent tech stack will be piloted in four metro cities before a nationwide rollout in FY26.</p>

<h2>Customer-First: The Experience Layer</h2>
<p>From mobile apps and chatbots to WhatsApp claim filing, LIC aims to modernize every customer touchpoint. Their goal: reduce new policy issuance from 14 days to 48 hours and claims settlement from 28 days to under a week.</p>
<p>“The trust LIC commands must now be matched with digital convenience,” said an IRDAI spokesperson. New apps will support vernacular UI, voice inputs, and Aadhaar-based e-KYC to widen accessibility.</p>

<h2>Risks and Roadblocks</h2>
<p>While LIC’s digital pivot is ambitious, execution remains a concern. Organizational inertia, vendor dependency, and data security are major risks. Analysts point to LIC’s historically bureaucratic decision-making process and low IT spending (<2% of revenue) as hurdles that must be addressed.</p>

<h2>Market Reaction</h2>
<p>Since the announcement, LIC’s stock has surged 12% amid broader optimism on public sector transformation. Brokerages including ICICI Securities and Motilal Oswal have revised LIC’s long-term outlook to “Buy.”</p>

<h2>What’s Next</h2>
<p>LIC has appointed a Chief Digital Officer from a global insurance major. A dedicated digital transformation task force is being created, reporting directly to the board. The first deliverables — customer mobile apps and a re-engineered online policy portal — are slated for December 2025.</p>
<p>If successful, LIC’s transformation could serve as a blueprint for legacy financial institutions seeking digital relevance in a hypercompetitive, tech-first world.</p>
