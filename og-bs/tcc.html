      <h1>The Consulting Crunch: India‚Äôs White-Collar Reset</h1>
      <p class="article-meta">By bataSutra Editorial Team | June 9, 2025</p>

      <p>It began quietly. A few deferred offers. Then unpublicized layoffs. And now ‚Äî a visible tightening across India‚Äôs most aspirational white-collar industry: consulting. As global demand falters, the consulting pipeline from top Indian B-schools is undergoing a generational reset.</p>

      <h2>üß≠ What's Changing?</h2>
      <p>For over a decade, strategy consulting was the endgame for India‚Äôs top-tier MBAs. In 2022, firms like McKinsey, BCG, Bain, and Big Four advisory arms hired aggressively from IIMs and ISB. But FY25 placements show a stark shift.</p>

      <p>Data from IIM Bangalore‚Äôs latest cycle reveals a 19% drop in strategy consulting offers. Lateral hiring in firms like EY-Parthenon and Kearney has frozen. Internally, global delivery centers are absorbing more execution than advisory mandates.</p>

      <h2>üìâ Demand Shock at the Top</h2>
      <p>With Fortune 500 clients slashing transformation budgets, global consulting HQs have pulled back on Asia growth bets. Even high-margin verticals like digital strategy and ESG are now bundled with tech delivery ‚Äî reducing the need for pure-play MBAs.</p>

      <p>More tellingly, Indian IT majors like Infosys and TCS are backfilling strategy roles with internal PMO leads instead of external consultants ‚Äî citing cost and continuity.</p>

      <h2>üéì The Campus Impact</h2>
      <p>ISB and IIM students report delayed joining dates and renegotiated offers. Tier-2 campuses that saw boutique consulting demand during the 2020 boom are now seeing ghosted interviews and freeze notices.</p>

      <p>This year‚Äôs lateral job market for ex-consultants isn‚Äôt faring better ‚Äî with many pivoting into product roles at SaaS firms or exploring public policy and think tank gigs.</p>

      <h2>üìä A Broader White-Collar Recalibration</h2>
      <p>This slowdown in consulting mirrors a larger truth: the Indian white-collar job market is entering its ‚Äúskills-over-pedigree‚Äù era. Employers are placing higher value on execution ability, domain knowledge, and cross-functional thinking over pure analytical polish.</p>

      <p>Consulting firms, too, are adjusting. Many are investing in AI ops platforms, reducing bench strength, and focusing on managed service partnerships with global clients instead of standalone projects.</p>

      <h2>üß† What Comes Next?</h2>
      <p>The consulting crunch may not last forever. But even when the cycle turns, the playbook will be different. Indian consulting talent will be expected to blend strategic thinking with digital acumen, operational know-how, and adaptability to client context ‚Äî not just deck-making skills.</p>

      <p>For India‚Äôs white-collar elite, this is a reminder: prestige isn‚Äôt protection. Only reinvention is.</p>
