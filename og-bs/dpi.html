    <h1>India‚Äôs DPI Supercharge: Building the Rails for Bharat‚Äôs Next Leap</h1>
    <div class="author">bataSutra | June 22, 2025</div>

    <p>While the world obsesses over AI apps and viral fintechs, India is quietly executing one of the most ambitious state-backed digital missions in modern history. What began with Aadhaar and UPI has now evolved into a full-stack digital operating system ‚Äî open-source, population-scale, and protocol-first.</p>

    <h2>üß± From Payments to Protocols</h2>
    <p>UPI clocked over 14 billion transactions in May alone. But that‚Äôs just the tip. ONDC is decentralizing commerce. Account Aggregator is shifting control of financial data. The Health Stack is digitizing care records. DigiLocker has crossed 250M users.</p>

    <p>Collectively, these tools form the **India Stack** ‚Äî modular, interoperable, and radically inclusive. They‚Äôre not just government tech. They‚Äôre infrastructure rails for the next wave of Indian startups, banks, and even global platforms.</p>

    <h2>üì¶ The ONDC Experiment</h2>
    <p>With Swiggy and Amazon as edge players, ONDC is reshaping ecommerce by cutting out rent-seeking middle layers. Seller commissions are as low as 2-3%. Kiranas, food vendors, and logistics startups are plugging in ‚Äî some for the first time.</p>

    <p>Daily orders on ONDC have now crossed 50,000 ‚Äî not yet Flipkart-levels, but growing 3x YoY. For many Tier-3 towns, it‚Äôs their first taste of platform parity.</p>

    <h2>üîê DPI x Credit: The Data Flip</h2>
    <p>India‚Äôs MSMEs face a $400B credit gap, often because lenders can‚Äôt assess risk. Enter **Account Aggregator**, flipping the model: instead of banks hoarding data, users can port their income history, GST filings, or cash flows across institutions securely ‚Äî with consent.</p>

    <p>Startups like CRIF, Finvu, and OneMoney are already live. Early use cases include invoice-based lending and instant business loans for GST-registered merchants. Some lenders now report 60% lower underwriting time.</p>

    <h2>üåè DPI as a Tech Export</h2>
    <p>The world is watching. Sri Lanka, Kenya, and Philippines are exploring UPI-style payment systems. World Bank calls it the ‚Äúmost advanced digital identity + payments infrastructure at scale.‚Äù</p>

    <p>With India offering DPI as public goods to other nations, this may become its most valuable soft power lever ‚Äî more than Bollywood or IT services ever were.</p>

    <h2>The bata takeaway</h2>
    <p>India‚Äôs DPI isn‚Äôt an app. It‚Äôs a new category of digital governance. If executed right, it could serve as the backend for Bharat‚Äôs trillion-dollar digital economy. In a world chasing headlines, DPI is playing the long game ‚Äî building silent infrastructure for the next billion users.</p>
